# Alchemy dAApp

This example dapp contains an account abstraction-enabled web3 application designed to onboard people onto the Alchemy Account Abstraction SDK. It provides a quick starter for developers to use these technologies, by creating a Smart Contract Wallet and minting an NFT!

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk.git
```
2. Navigate to the examples/alchemy-daapp directory:
```bash
cd aa-sdk/examples/alchemy-daapp
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash 
yarn install
```

## Getting Started
1. Update the .env file with your Alchemy API key(s):
```bash
MUMBAI_ALCHEMY_API_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

2. Update the env.mjs file with your Alchemy API URL:
```javascript
export const alchemyApiKey = "<your-api-key>";
```

3. Update the configs/clientConfigs.ts file with your contract addresses and policy ids:
```typescript
export const serverConfigs: Record<number, ServerConfiguration> = {
  [polygonMumbai.id]: {
    nftContractAddress: "<your-nft-contract-address>",
    lightAccountFactoryAddress: "<your-light-account-factory-address>",
    gasManagerPolicyId: "<your-gas-manager-policy-id>",
    chain: polygonMumbai,
  },
  // Repeat for other chains as needed
};
```
### **üóíÔ∏è Notes:** for `nftContractAddress` and `lightAccountFactoryAddress` 
- There are already contract addresses deployed for them across [various chains here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/examples/alchemy-daapp/src/configs/clientConfigs.ts).
- We used Alchemy's [lightAccountFactory here]. todo(ajay): post the repo when live
- Finally, the contracts sibling package has the copy of the [NFT contract](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/contracts/DAAppNFT/src) along instructions on [how to deploy it](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/examples/contracts/README.md).

4. Update the serverConfigs.ts file with your alchemy API keys:
```typescript
const API_URLs: Record<number, string> = {
  [polygonMumbai.id]: env.MUMBAI_ALCHEMY_API_URL,
  // Repeat for other chains as needed...
};
```

5. Start the app:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## How This Works
The [`onboarding-controller.ts`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/master/examples/alchemy-daapp/src/surfaces/onboarding/OnboardingController.ts) file contains the onboarding controller, which handles the onboarding process for new users. The controller uses the Alchemy SDK to create a new account and mint an NFT.

In the [`clientConfigs.ts`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/examples/alchemy-daapp/src/configs/clientConfigs.ts) file, you will find the configuration for the DAApp, including the nft contract address, light account factory address, gas manager policy id, rpc url, and chain. You'll also find an example NFT contract in [`examples/contracts/DAAppNFT`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/contracts/DAAppNFT)

You can replace the default values with your contract addresses and policy ids and add or remove chains as needed.
