/**
 * [Hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSigner.ts) for accessing the current Alchemy signer within a React component. It uses a synchronous external store for updates.
 * This is a good use case if you want to use the signer as an EOA, giving you direct access to it. The signer returned from `useSigner` just does a `personal_sign` or `eth_signTypedData` without any additional logic, but a smart contract account might have additional logic for creating signatures for 1271 validation so `useSignMessage` or `useSignTypeData` instead.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { useSigner } from "@account-kit/react";
 *
 * const signer = useSigner();
 * ```
 *
 * @returns {AlchemyWebSigner | null} The current Alchemy signer or null if none is available. [ref](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/signer/src/client/index.ts#L50)
