# Email Magic Link Authentication

Email magic link authentication allows you to log in and sign up users using an email address. Your users will receive a link in their inbox which will redirect them to your site (configured in the dashboard) to complete login.

:::tip
We recommend using the OTP email flow instead, as it is more reliable across different browser environments. OTP flows have also been shown to have up to a 3x higher conversion rate and a 10-second faster flow compared to magic link.

For setting up the OTP flow, see [Email OTP Authentication](/signer/authentication/email-otp).

## Authenticate a user

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

// send the email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  emailMode: "magicLink",
  email: "user@mail.com",
});

// later once the user has clicked the link
const url = new URL(window.location.href);
const bundle = url.searchParams.get("bundle");
if (!bundle) {
  throw new Error("No bundle found in URL");
}

await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  bundle,
});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```
