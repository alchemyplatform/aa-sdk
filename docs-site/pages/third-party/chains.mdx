# AA only chains or non-Alchemy chains

If you're using a chain that isn't supported by us or we only support Account Abstraction methods for those chains, then you can use `createSmartAccountClient` or one of non-alchemy `create*Client` methods from `@account-kit/smart-contracts`
with a `split` transport to route your traffic accordingly.

## AA only chains example

For AA only chains, the `alchemyTransport` allows you to specify both the Alchemy Connection object as well as pass in a Node RPC URL, allowing you to split traffic between Alchemy's Bundler and Paymaster RPC and your Node RPC provider.

```ts twoslash
import { zora, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { createLightAccountAlchemyClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";

const smartAccountClient = createLightAccountAlchemyClient({
  transport: alchemy({
    alchemyConnection: {
      apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
    },
    nodeRpcUrl: "ZORA_NODE_RPC_URL",
  }),
  chain: zora,
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.generatePrivateKeySigner(),
});
```

## Non-Alchemy chains example

To use non-Alchemy supported chains, you can use the `createSmartAccountClient` method from `@aa-sdk/core` or any of the non-Alchemy `create*Client` methods exported from `@account-kit/smart-contracts` with a `chain` definition for your chain and a `transport` pointing to your RPC provider.

See [`createSmartAccountClient`](/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/createSmartAccountClient) for more information.
