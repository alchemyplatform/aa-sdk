# account-kit/signer

The `@account-kit/signer` package contains all of the interfaces and functions that allow you to interact with our Signer service.
This package is designed for developers who want to build their own integrations using our Signer as an owner on Smart Accounts, but would rather bring their own infra or smart contract implementations.

For a fully integrated stack, consider using the `@account-kit/core` or `@account-kit/react` packages.
