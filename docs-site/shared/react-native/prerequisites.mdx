## Pre-requisites

- React Native version 0.76 or later
- iOS Minumum Deployment Target: 17.0
- [Hermes](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes) and [Fabric](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/fabric-renderer) must be enabled (if using expo these are on by default)
- The Signer package requires you to be on React Native's [new architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page#should-i-use-the-new-architecture-today). For information on how to enable it in your Expo project, check their [documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/new-architecture/).
- The Signer package is incompatible with Expo Go and as a result, you'd
  need to use a Development Build. Check the [Expo Development Builds documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/)
  for more information.
