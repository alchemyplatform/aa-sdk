# How to set up a smart account client

Once users are [authenticated](/react/getting-started), you can start landing transactions onchain using a Smart Account Client. Setting up a new account client is easy using the `useSmartAccountClient` hook!

This extends `viem`'s [Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/custom#build-your-own-client), enabling account creation, sending transactions, signing messages, sponsoring gas, and more. It's also EIP-1193 compliant, so you can swap it in for other web3 providers like `window.ethereum`.
