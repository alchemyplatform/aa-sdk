# How to Submit Batch Transactions

One benefit of Smart Contract Accounts is that it's possible to batch transactions in one User Operation. Not all Smart Contract Accounts support batching. But, if the `ISmartContractAccount` implementation you're using has the [`encodeBatchExecute`](/packages/aa-core/accounts/optional/encodeBatchExecute.md) method, then implementations of `SmartAccountProvider` will allow you to make those calls.

There are two ways you can batch transactions using `SmartAccountProvider`:

1. via `sendUserOperation`
2. via `sendTransactions`

:::tip Note 1: `SimpleSmartContractAccount` and `LightSmartContractAccount`
Both `SimpleSmartContractAccount` and `LightSmartContractAccount` implement `encodeBatchExecute`, thus supports batching `UserOperations` out of the box.
:::

:::tip Note 2: Transactions Batched as a Single User Operation
When you batch transactions, the transaction actions (`target`s and `calldata`s) are batched into a single `UserOperation`, where the sender is the account itself.
:::

:::tip Note 3: Batched Transactions Ordering
The batched `UserOperation` gets executed by the account calling the `executeBatch` method on the [`SimpleAccount`](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/ver0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) or [`LightAccount`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/v1.0.2/src/LightAccount.sol) smart contracts. `executeBatch` processes the input array of transactions data linearly, guaranteeing the execution order of those transactions to be **sequential**.
:::

## Batching using [`sendUserOperation`](/packages/aa-core/provider/sendUserOperation.md)

The `SmartAccountProvider` supports passing either a single `UserOperation` or an array of `UserOperation`s to `sendUserOperation`. If you pass an array, the provider will batch the transactions into a single User Operation and submit it to the bundler. Let's see an example:

::: code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { provider } from "./provider";
// [!code focus:99]
// the hash returned here is the hash of the User Operation
const { hash } = await provider.sendUserOperation([
  {
    target: "0x...",
    data: "0xcallDataTransacation1",
  },
  {
    target: "0x...",
    data: "0xcallDataTransacation2",
  },
]);
```

## Batching using [`sendTransactions`](/packages/aa-core/provider/sendTransactions.md)

The `SmartAccountProvider` supports sending `UserOperation`s and waiting for them to be mined in a transaction via the `sendTransaction` and `sendTransactions` methods. The latter allows for batching in the same way `sendUserOperation`:

::: code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { provider } from "./provider";
// [!code focus:99]
// the hash returned here is the hash of the mined Tx that includes the UserOperation
const hash = await provider.sendTransactions([
  {
    to: "0x...",
    data: "0xcallDataTransacation1",
  },
  {
    to: "0x...",
    data: "0xcallDataTransacation2",
  },
]);
```
