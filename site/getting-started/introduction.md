# Quick start

This guide will show you how to create Embedded Accounts using Account Kit, the Alchemy Signer, and the Alchemy Modular Smart Contract Account.

By the end of this guide, you will have set up a basic web application where users sign up with email, silently deploy a Modular Account onchain, and send UserOperations (UOs) with zero gas using the [Alchemy Rundler](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/rundler) and Alchemy Gas Manager.

Here’s a demo video below of the experience you’ll be building!

::: tip Want to get started right away?
The complete demo you are building is available in [this Github repo](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart).

If you want to just `git clone` this repo, follow only the [`Configure your Embedded Accounts`](/getting-started/configure-eas) section to add the relevant environment variables from Alchemy. Then, follow the ReadMe for instructions to build and run the app.

Otherwise, go through the full tutorial step-by-step to build Embedded Accounts from scratch.
