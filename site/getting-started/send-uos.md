# Send UserOperations

All that’s left to do is enable users to send UserOperations through their newly created Embedded Account on your app. Add a new query to `src/queries/sendUserOperation.tsx`:

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/send-uos/sendUserOperation.tsx [src/queries/sendUserOperation.tsx]

This method will send a request to Alchemy’s infrastructure to send a UserOperation. It uses the `AlchemySmartAccountClient` from the Alchemy Account Kit. Check out the [AlchemySmartAccountClient docs](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/packages/aa-alchemy/smart-account-client/) for more details.

Now, incorporate this request on a new `src/components/SendUOButton.tsx` file and add it to the `src/components/ProfileCard.tsx` for authenticated users to send a UO. These files should look as follows:

::: code-group

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/send-uos/ProfileCard.tsx [src/components/ProfileCard.tsx]

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/send-uos/SendUOButton.tsx [src/components/SendUOButton.tsx]

:::

That’s it! You’ve now enabled users to sendUOs from their Embedded Account on your application, and the experience should look like the video below!

Congratulations! Using Account Kit, the Alchemy Signer, and Alchemy Modular Smart Contract Account, you created an application that authenticates a user by email to create their Embedded Account, and then uses that account to send a UserOperation!
