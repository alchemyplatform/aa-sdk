# Setup your application

This section will walk you through the steps to create your application, install the necessary dependencies, and write the boilerplate code you’ll need to integrate Embedded Accounts!

## Create your app

First, create a [NextJS React application](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) by running `npx create-next-app` from your terminal in a project directory of your choice. Select the default configuration for each question the `create-next-app` CLI.

## Install dependencies

In this newly created directory for your app, add the following dependencies:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-core viem @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-core viem @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-core viem @tanstack/react-query
```

:::

The three Alchemy packages - `@alchemy/aa-alchemy`, `@alchemy/aa-accounts`, and `@alchemy/aa-core` - come from the [Alchemy Account Kit](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/), and will provide the key building blocks for created Embedded Accounts.

[`viem`](https://viem.sh/) is a useful Web3 Utils library and a key dependency of Account Kit.

[`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is a popular library for managing client-side state in NextJS and React applications. You’re welcome to use another state management library or vanilla react, but the rest of this demo will use ReactQuery.

## Set up your backend

Using your code editor, open your newly created application directory to add the backend! Your application’s backend will serve as an API that your frontend will use to send requests to Alchemy’s infrastructure to sign messages, send UserOperations, and track your users’ Embedded Account activity.

From the root of NextJS project’s directory, using the NextJS concept of [route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), create new directory `src/app/api/rpc` and add two files: `src/app/api/rpc/[..routes]/route.ts` to handle calls to the Alchemy Signer, and `src/app/api/rpc/route.ts` to handle requests to Alchemy’s infrastructure. Copy the following into those files.

::: code-group

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/setup-app/route.ts [src/app/api/route.ts]

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/setup-app/routes.ts [src/app/api/[...routes]/route.ts]

:::

Notice that here, you’ll be using the `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` environment variable you set in an earlier step. Also note that the backend routes will make requests to Alchemy’s infrastructure for the Arbitrum Sepolia network.

## Set up your frontend

Before building your app’s UI, you’ll want configure a [NextJS router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating) and [a ReactQuery client](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider) to manage state around requests the app will make, and wrap components that use. From the root of NextJS project’s directory, create a file `src/app/providers.tsx` and initialize these providers.

Then, in the `src/app/layout.tsx` file that came with the NextJS boilerplate, wrap the `children` component in the `Providers` component you just created in `src/app/providers.tsx`.

These two files should look as follows:

::: code-group

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/setup-app/layout.tsx [src/app/layout.tsx]

<<< @/snippets/getting-started/setup-app/providers.tsx [src/app/providers.tsx]

:::

Now, you have all the pieces in place to build a new web application using Embedded Accounts! In the next step of this guide, you’ll integrate the Alchemy Signer to enable your app to sign users into their newly created Embedded Accounts.
