# How to use your own Account Signer

Account Kit is designed to be flexible and allow you to use any Signer you want. If you don't want to use any Signer implementations in [`aa-signers`](/packages/aa-signers/index), you can either:

1. Implement [`SmartAccountSigner`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/packages/core/src/signer/types.ts#L34) (exported in `aa-core`).
2. If your Signer is an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compliant provider, you can leverage `viem`'s `WalletClient` and the [`WalletClientSigner`](/packages/aa-core/signers/wallet-client) (exported in `aa-core`).

:::tip Note
If you want to add your Signer implementation to Account Kit's codebase, take a look at the [contibuting](/signers/contributing) docs. We welcome Pull Requests onto the Github repo for [`aa-sdk`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk)!
:::

## 1. Implementing `SmartAccountAuthenticator` or `SmartAccountSigner`

Smart accounts in Account Kit expect an implementation of `SmartAccountSigner` to work in Account Kit. We also include a `SmartAccountAuthenticator` interface that extends `SmartAccountSigner` and wraps any SDKs you may wish to use as part of the implementation of your own Signer.

<<< @/../packages/core/src/signer/types.ts

## 2. Using `WalletClientSigner`

Viem allows you to create a `WalletClient`, which can be used to wrap local or JSON RPC based wallets. You can see the complete docs for leveraging the `WalletClient` [here](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

We support a `SmartAccountSigner` implementation called `WalletClientSigner` that makes it really easy to use a viem `WalletClient` as a signer on your Smart Contract Account. If your Signer is [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compliant, it is really easy to use with `WalletClient`. Let's take a look at a simple example:
