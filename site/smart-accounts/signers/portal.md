# Portal Integration Guide

[Portal](https://www.portalhq.io/) is an embedded blockchain infrastructure company that powers companies with an end to end platform for key management for self-custodial wallets (MPC and AA), security firewall, and web3 protocol connect kit.

A combination of Portal and Alchemy's Account Kit allows you to have robust key management and security, while also exploring everything that web3 has to offer with smart contract accounts for your users.

## Integration

Check out Portal's developer [docs](https://docs.portalhq.io/) to learn more about Portal. If you want to get quick access to their SDKs, please reach out via [this](https://5g2cefp2j92.typeform.com/portal-labs?typeform-source=www.portalhq.io) form.

### Install the Portal SDK

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install --save @portal-hq/web
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @portal-hq/web
```

:::

### Create a SmartAccountSigner

Next, setup the Portal SDK and create a `SmartAccountSigner`:

<<< @/snippets/portal.ts

### Use it with LightAccount

Let's see it in action with `aa-alchemy` and `LightSmartContractAccount` from `aa-accounts`:
::: code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { AlchemyProvider } from "@alchemy/aa-alchemy";
import { LightSmartContractAccount } from "@alchemy/aa-accounts";
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains";
import { portalSigner } from "./portalSigner";

const chain = polygonMumbai;
const provider = new AlchemyProvider({
  apiKey: process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY,
  chain,
}).connect(
  (rpcClient) =>
    new LightSmartContractAccount({
      entryPointAddress: ENTRY_POINT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      chain: rpcClient.chain,
      owner: portalSigner,
      factoryAddress: FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      rpcClient,
    })
);
```

<<< @/snippets/portal.ts
