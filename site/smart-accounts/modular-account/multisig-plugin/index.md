# Multisig Plugin

## Overview

The Multisig plugin allows your account to have multiple ECDSA or SCA signers and require a threshold number of signatures for account transactions. This is commonly referred to as a k-of-n threshold signature scheme and would create Modular Accounts that are similar to [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/) accounts. This plugin is recommended for accounts looking for maximally secure configurations.

## Secure, audited, open source

Multisig Plugin has been audited by Quantstamp. You can find the audit reports [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/multisig-plugin/blob/develop/audits). Multisig Plugin is fully open source, so you can validate the [source code](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/multisig-plugin).
