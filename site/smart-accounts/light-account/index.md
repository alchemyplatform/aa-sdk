# Light Account

## Overview

Light Account is an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart account. We started with the Ethereum Foundationâ€™s canonical [SimpleAccount](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) and added key improvements. It is fully production-ready with a security [audit](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/Quantstamp-Audit.pdf), gas optimizations, and [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature support. Additionally, Light Account supports ownership transfer to ensure you and your user don't get locked into a particular Signer.

## Getting started

The code snippet below demonstrates how to use Light Account with Account Kit. It creates a Light Account and sends a `UserOperation` from it:
::: code-group

<<< @/snippets/aa-alchemy/light-account.ts [aa-alchemy]

::: code-group

::: tip Address calculation
For the Light Account, the address of the smart account will be calculated as a combination of [the owner and the salt](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/src/LightAccountFactory.sol#L24-L33). You will get the same smart account address each time you supply the same `owner`, the signer used to create the account for the first time. Alternatively, you can supply `salt` if you want a different address for the same `owner` param (the default salt is `0n`).

If you want to use a signer to connect to an account whose address does not map to the contract-generated address, you can supply the `accountAddress` to connect with the account of interest. In that case, the `signer` address is not used for address calculation, but only used for signing the operation.
