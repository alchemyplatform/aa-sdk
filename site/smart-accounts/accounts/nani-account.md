# Nani Account

## Overview

Nani Account is an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart account. It is built on the the Ethereum Foundationâ€™s canonical [SimpleAccount](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) and extended to support modular plugins or "validators" using a custom nonce-storage method. It's fully production-ready, built on the Solady audited smart contract library, and reviewed by active smart account developers from Sound, ZeroDev and Alchemy ([audit](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/pull/639)).

## Why Nani Account

### Gas-optimized

Nani Account is the [the most gas-optimized smart account](https://github.com/zerodevapp/aa-benchmark/commit/4b8e548ef6b004069cff599347a2afb9ac837e54) in production, using cutting-edge efficiency techniques (like calldata compression and fallback token receipts) with low-level assembly code to drastically reduce the cost of verifying and executing account operations.

### Fully-featured

Nani Account supports nested [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) contract signatures, calldata compression for greater performance on L2, and a minimal ERC1967 UUPS (upgradeability) path. Nani Account also permits ownership transfers so that users don't get locked into a particular Signer.

### Secure, Audited, Open Source

Nani Account is built on the foundation of the [Solady library](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady), an audited and performant codebase for efficient smart contracts. You can find Solady audit reports [here](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/tree/main/audits). Nani Account is also fully open source so you can validate the [source code](https://github.com/NaniDAO/accounts).

### Modular Now

Nani Account supports validator plugins that allow users to add custom logic and authorization flows on Day 1, such as timelocking certain assets or actions, adding multiple signers to their account, as well as planning future transactions on automated schedules. These modular features rely on Nani Accounts' custom nonce-storage system, which improves the visibility and discoverability of plugins and related actions by using the ERC-4337 entry point's own accounting logic. When a user wants to enable or remove a plugin, they simply update their accounts' storage without requiring a delegatecall or full upgrade.

Nani Account is also designed with future compatibility in mind, ready to adapt to [EIP-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) and other potential smart account standards. This allows for seamless upgrades to a 6900-compatible account and the integration of preferences when available.
