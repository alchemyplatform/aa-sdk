# Light Account

**Secure, optimized, and extendable**

## Overview

Light Account is an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart account. We started with the Ethereum Foundationâ€™s canonical [SimpleAccount](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) and added key improvements. It's fully production-ready with a security [audit](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/Quantstamp-Audit.pdf), gas optimizations, and [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature support. Additionally, Light Account supports ownership transfer to ensure you and your user don't get locked into a particular signer.

## Why Light Account

### Gas-optimized

Light Account is engineered to minimize gas costs, as measured by the following benchmarks for common operations like native token transfers, ERC20 transfers, and account creation.

### Secure, Audited, Open Source

Light Account has been audited by Quantstamp. You can find the audit report [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/Quantstamp-Audit.pdf). Light Account is is also fully open source so you can validate the [source code](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account).

### Modular 6900 Accounts (Coming Soon)

We're pioneering the future of modular smart accounts with [EIP-6900](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/account-abstraction-erc-6900). We're developing a [Modular Account](./modular-account.md) to support EIP-6900 coming soon. Light Account is designed with that future in mind. It is forward-compatible with EIP-6900 so you can upgrade it to 6900-compatible account once the Modular Account is ready.

## Using Light Account

The code snippet below demonstrates how to use Light Account with Account Kit. It creates a Light Account and sends a `UserOperation` from it:
