# Contributing Your Account

If you'd like to add your smart account to Account Kit, we welcome PRs! You'll need to fork the [`aa-sdk` Github repo](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk) and then follow the below steps.

## 1. Add Your Smart Account to [`aa-accounts`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/packages/accounts)

To ensure the best developer experience for anyone using Account Kit, we ask that you add your smart account implementation to our [`aa-accounts`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/packages/accounts) SDK package.

There, you'll want to add an implemention of the [`SmartContractAccount`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/packages/core/src/account/smartContractAccount.ts) interface from `aa-core`. Simply export a function `createMySmartContractAccount` which calls `toSmartContractAccount` and any custom setup you need for your account. Make sure to include unit tests along with your implementation!

## 2. Add Documentation about Your Smart Account

You'll want to add documentation about your smart account so that developers can easily use your implementation in Account Kit. Below, we recommend adding documentation about your smart account's APIs, as well.

To ensure these docs are visible on the Account Kit docs, you'll want to add links to them in the [`site/.vitepress/config.ts`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/site/.vitepress/config.ts) file in the `aa-sdk` repo, where there is a `sidebar` property in the object.

Find the `aa-accounts` item in the `sidebar` and add a new entry in `items`. The `text` property of the entry is what will be visible in the sidebar and the `link` property should be `kebab-case`:

```ts
{
  sidebar: [
    // ... other packages
    {
      text: "aa-accounts",
      collapsed: true,
      base: "/packages/aa-accounts",
      items: [
        // ... other entries
        {
          text: "Your Account",
          collapsed: true,
          base: "/packages/aa-accounts/your-account-name",
          items: [
            // ... all methods on the smart account implementation
          ],
        },
        // ... other smart accounts and more
        { text: "Contributing", link: "/contributing" },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

In that section, add documentation introducing the value prop of your smart account, how to initialize the smart account object, and how to call each method.

## 3. Submit a Pull Request

You can open a PR to merge the branch with your smart account implementation from your forked repo into the `main` branch of the `aa-sdk` repo. We'll make sure to review it promptly, provider feedback, and merge the PR when ready so that developers can use your smart account!
