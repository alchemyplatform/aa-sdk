# sendTransaction

`sendTransaction` is a method on `AccountSigner` that sends transactions on behalf of the `AccountSigner`'s smart account, with request and response formatted as if you were using the ethers.js library.

Note that `to` field of transaction is required, and among other fields of transaction, only `data`, `value`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields are considered and optional. Support for other fields is coming soon.

## Usage

::: code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./ethers-signer";

const txHash = await signer.sendTransaction({
  from, // ignored
  to,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: ContractABI.abi,
    functionName: "func",
    args: [arg1, arg2, ...],
  }),
});
```
