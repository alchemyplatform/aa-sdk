# `@alchemy/aa-ethers`

This package contains `EthersProviderAdapter` and `AccountSigner`, respective extensions of the [`JsonRpcProvider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/) and [`Signer`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Signer-getaddress) classes defined in [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) external library.

If you currently rely `ethers.js` for web3 development, you can use these `ethers.js`-compatible `JsonRpcProvider` and `Signer` to integrate Account Abstraction into your dApp. You may also find the [`util`](./utils/introduction.md) methods helpful.

This repo is community maintained and we welcome contributions!
