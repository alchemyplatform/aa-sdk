# `@alchemy/aa-ethers`

This package contains `EthersProviderAdapter` and `AccountSigner`, respective extensions of the `JsonRpcProvider` and `Signer` classes defined in `ethers.js` external library.

If you currently rely `ethers.js` for web3 development, you can use these `ethers.js`-compatible `JsonRpcProvider` and `Signer` to integrate Account Abstraction into your dApp. You may also find the [`util`](./utils/introduction.md) methods helpful.

This repo is community maintained and we welcome contributions!

## Getting started

If you are already using the `@alchemy/aa-core` package, you can simply install this package and start using the `EthersProviderAdapter` and `AccountSigner`. If you are not using `@alchemy/aa-core`, you can install it and follow the instructions in the ["Getting Started"](/getting-started) docs to get started.
