# LightAccountClientActions

`SmartAccountClient` actions used to interact with the [`LightAccount`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/src/LightAccount.sol) contract for the connected account. Used by extending the `LightAccount` connected `SmartAccountClient` with the `lightAccountClientActions` decorator.

```ts
export type LightAccountClientActions<
  TOwner extends SmartAccountSigner = SmartAccountSigner,
  TAccount extends LightAccount<TOwner> | undefined =
    | LightAccount<TOwner>
    | undefined
> = {
  transferOwnership: (
    args: {
      newOwner: TOwner;
      waitForTxn?: boolean;
    } & GetAccountParameter<TAccount, LightAccount>
  ) => Promise<Hex>;
};
```
