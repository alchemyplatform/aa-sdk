# Public ERC-4337 Client

Viem exports a `PublicClient` and utilities for creating the `PublicClient`. We extend that functionality here to provide a `PublicClient` that is also typed to work with the RPC endpoints introduced in [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

The `PublicErc4337Client` also has a number of methods that wrap the RPC Methods below to make it easier to interact with the RPC provider.

## RPC Methods

### `eth_sendUserOperation`

Sends a user operation to the RPC provider to be included in a bundle.

#### Parameters

- `[UserOperationRequest, Address]` - The User Operation Request to be submitted and the address of the Entrypoint to be used for the operation.

#### Returns

- `Hash` - The hash of the User Operation.

### `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`

Sends a user operation to the RPC provider and returns gas estimates for the User Operation.

#### Parameters

- `[UserOperationRequest, Address]` - The User Operation Request to be submitted and the address of the Entrypoint to be used for the operation.

#### Returns

- `UserOperationEstimateGasResponse` - gas estimates for the `UserOperation` (UO).

### `eth_getUserOperationReceipt`

Given a User Operation hash, returns the User Operation Receipt.

#### Parameters

- `[Hash]` - The hash of the User Operation to get the receipt for.

#### Returns

- `UserOperationReceipt | null` - The User Operation Receipt or null if the User Operation has not been included in a block yet.

### `eth_getUserOperationByHash`

Given a User Operation hash, returns the User Operation.

#### Parameters
