# withAlchemyGasManager

`withAlchemyGasManager` is a method on `AlchemyProvider` that you can optionally call to create a new provider instance with added middleware leveraging the Alchemy Gas Manager (an [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) Paymaster). Under the hood, this will call the [`withAlchemyGasManager`](/packages/aa-alchemy/middleware/withAlchemyGasManager.ts).

## Usage

```ts [example.ts]
import { provider } from "./provider";
// [!code focus:99]

// use Alchemy Gas Manager to sponsorship transactions
const providerWithGasManager = provider.withAlchemyGasManager({
  policyId: PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID,
});
```

<<< @/snippets/provider.ts

## Returns

### `AlchemyProvider`

A new instance of an `AlchemyProvider` with the same attributes as the input, now with middleware for accessing the Alchemy Gas Manager to sponsor UserOperations.

## Parameters

### `config: AlchemyGasManagerConfig`

- `policyId: string` -- the Alchemy Gas Manager policy ID
