# withAlchemyEnhancedApis

`withAlchemyEnhancedApis` is a method on `AlchemyProvider` that you can optionally call to create a new provider instance with added methods that access the Alchemy [Enhanced APIs](https://www.alchemy.com/enhanced-apis) via the [Alchemy SDK](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/alchemy-sdk-js).

:::tip Note
This method requires a peer dependency on the [`alchemy-sdk`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/alchemy-sdk-js) package, as the input to this method is an Alchemy SDK client.

The Alchemy SDK client must be configured with the same API key and network as the AlchemyProvider. This method validates such at runtime.

Additionally, since the Alchemy SDK client does not yet support JWT authentication, an `AlchemyProvider` initialized with JWTs cannot use this method. They must be initialized with an API key or RPC URL.

## Usage

::: code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { provider } from "./provider";
// [!code focus:99]

const alchemy = new Alchemy();

// use Alchemy Enhanced APIs
const providerWithEnhancedApis = provider.withAlchemyEnhancedApis(alchemy);
```

<<< @/snippets/provider.ts

## Returns

### `AlchemyProvider`

A new instance of an `AlchemyProvider` with the same attributes as the input, now with methods for accessing the Alchemy Enhanced APIs to more efficiently query blockchain data.

## Parameters

### `alchemy: Alchemy` -- an initialized Alchemy SDK client
