# `@alchemy/aa-alchemy`

This package contains `AlchemyProvider`, an implementation of `SmartAccountProvider` class defined in `aa-core`. It also contains middleware for accessing the Alchemy Gas Manager (an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) Paymaster) and for doing Fee Estimates according to the expectations of the Alchemy [Rundler](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/rundler/tree/main) (an ERC-4337 Bundler). You may also find the util methods helpful. This repo is community maintained and we welcome contributions!
