## Pre-requisites

- React Native version 0.76 or later
- iOS Minumum Deployment Target: 17.0
- The Signer package requires you to be on React Native's new architecture. For information on how to enable it in your Expo project, check their [documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/new-architecture/).
- The Signer package is incompatible with Expo Go and as a result, you'd
need to use a Development Build. Check the [Expo Development Builds documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/)
for more information.
