1. Get your API key by **creating a new app** in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
   :::warning
   Make sure **Ethereum Sepolia** is enabled (new apps are multi-chain and will have this enabled by default)
   :::
2. Create a **new account config** in your [Alchemy Accounts Manager Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)
   1. Apply the config to your app from step 1
      <img
        src="/images/apply-config-to-app.png"
        alt="apply your the config to the app from the first step"
      />
   2. Use [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/) as the “Redirect URL” for testing (\*\*\*make sure to set http NOT https for local testing)
      <img
        src="/images/redirect-url.png"
        alt="alchemy create new embedded account config highlighting where to set localhost"
      />
   3. Determine the authentication methods you want to support.
      1. If you are using email auth, you can optionally stylize ✨ the email with your brand color and logo!
      2. If you want to enable social login, toggle which auth providers you want to support, optionally enter your own Oauth credentials or use our defaults, and use [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/) as a whitelisted origin for testing.

           src="/images/configure-social.png"
           alt="alchemy create new embedded account config highlighting where to configure social login"
         />
3. Copy the **API Key** found at the end of the URL (you don't need the whole link for this demo)
