1. Get your API key by **creating a new app** in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
   :::warning
   Make sure **Ethereum Sepolia** is enabled (new apps are multi-chain and will have this enabled by default)
   :::
2. Create a **new account config** in your [Alchemy Accounts Manager Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)
   1. Use [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/) as the “Redirect URL” for testing (\*\*\*make sure to set http NOT https for local testing)

      />
   2. Optionally, stylize ✨ the auth email with your brand color and logo!
   3. Apply the config to your app from step 1
      <img

        alt="apply your the config to the app from the first step"
      />
3. Copy the **API Key** found at the end of the URL (you don't need the whole link for this demo)
