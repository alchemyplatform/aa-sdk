1.  Get your **API key** by creating a new app in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
    :::warning
    Make sure **Ethereum Sepolia** is enabled (new apps are multi-chain and will have this enabled by default)
    :::
2.  Create a **new account config** in your [Account Kit Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)

    1.  Apply the config to your app from step 1

        <img

          alt="apply your the config to the app from the first step"
          style={{ width: "50%" }}
        />

    2.  Enable authentication methods you want to support.

        <br />
        **Email auth**

        If you want to use email auth, toggle on email.

        - Use [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
          as the “Redirect URL” for testing (Note **http** not https for local testing)
        - Optionally stylize ✨ the email with your brand color and logo!

        <img
          src="/images/getting-started/email-auth-setup.png"
          alt="configure email auth"
          style={{ width: "50%" }}
        />

        <br />
        **Social auth**

        If you want to enable social login, toggle which auth providers
        you want to support.

        - Add [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) as a "whitelisted origin" for testing.
        - Optionally enter your own OAuth credentials or use our defaults.

          <img
            src="/images/getting-started/social-auth-setup.png"
            alt="configure social auth"
            style={{ width: "50%" }}
          />

3.  Create config and copy the **API Key**
    <img
      src="/images/getting-started/get-api-key.png"
      alt="how to copy the api key"
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />
