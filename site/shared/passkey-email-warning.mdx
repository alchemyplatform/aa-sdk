If you create a passkey without an email associated with the user, you risk your users losing access to their wallets if they lose their device.

**Recommended security practice:** Proxy authentication requests to your backend server to enforce additional security measures:

- When a user attempts to sign up with both passkey and email, you can first require email verification before allowing the passkey to be created
- Alternatively, you can restrict initial signup to email-based methods only (which inherently verify email ownership), then allow users to add passkeys after their account is established
- This approach gives you greater control over the authentication flow and helps prevent account recovery issues

By implementing server-side verification, you ensure that passkeys are only created for verified identities, reducing the risk of permanent access loss.
