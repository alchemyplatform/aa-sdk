# Passkey Signup

The Alchemy Signer allows you to sign up users to your application using a [passkey](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#passkey) on their device.

To add passkey signup functionality to your app, you can use the [`authenticate`](/packages/aa-alchemy/signer/authenticate#parameters) method on the Alchemy Signer as follows.
