# Passkey Auth

The Alchemy Signer allows you to authenticate and log in users with a [passkey](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#passkey) that they used previously to sign up to your application.

To add passkey auth functionality to your app, you can use the [`authenticate`](/packages/aa-alchemy/signer/authenticate#parameters) method on the Alchemy Signer as follows.
