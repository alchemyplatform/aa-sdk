# buildUserOperationFromTx

Converts a traditional Ethereum transaction and builds an _unsigned_ `UserOperation` (UO) struct with all middleware of the `SmartAccountClient` run through the client middleware pipeline.

Learn more about [`ClientMiddleware`](/packages/aa-core/smart-account-client/middleware/) to learn more about the internals of `SmartAccountClient` middleware pipeline that builds the user operation request given the user transaction call data and the operating account data.

:::tip[Note]
Note that `to`, `data`, `value`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields of the transaction request type are considered and used to build the user operation from the transaction, while other fields are not used.

## Usage

:::code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import type { RpcTransactionRequest } from "viem";
import { smartAccountClient } from "./smartAccountClient";
// [!code focus:99]
// buildUserOperationFromTx converts a traditional Ethereum transaction and returns
// the unsigned user operation struct after constructing the user operation struct
// through the middleware pipeline
const tx: RpcTransactionRequest = {
  from, // ignored
  to,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: ContractABI.abi,
    functionName: "func",
    args: [arg1, arg2, ...],
  }),
};
const uoStruct = await smartAccountClient.buildUserOperationFromTx(tx);

// signUserOperation signs the above unsigned user operation struct built
// using the account connected to the smart account client
const request = await smartAccountClient.signUserOperation({ uoStruct });

// You can use the BundlerAction `sendRawUserOperation` (packages/core/src/actions/bundler/sendRawUserOperation.ts)
// to send the signed user operation request to the bundler, requesting the bundler to send the signed uo to the
// EntryPoint contract pointed at the entryPoint address parameter
const entryPointAddress = client.account.getEntryPoint().address;
const uoHash = await smartAccountClient.sendRawUserOperation({ request, entryPoint: entryPointAddress });
```

```ts [smartAccountClient.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/aa-core/smartAccountClient.ts]
```

## Returns

### `Promise<BuildUserOperationFromTransactionsResult>`

A `Promise` containing the _unsigned_ UO struct converted from the input transaction with all the middleware run on the resulting UO
