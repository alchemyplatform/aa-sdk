# dropAndReplaceUserOperation

Attempts to drop and replace an existing user operation by increasing fees. The fee replacement logic sets the `maxPriorityFee` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to the `max(current_estimate, prev_uo * 1.1)` (i.e. the current max fee or 110% of the previous fee).

## Usage

:::code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { smartAccountClient } from "./smartAccountClient";

const { request } = await smartAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    data: "0xCalldata",
    target: "0xTarget",
    value: 0n,
  },
});

const { hash: replacedHash } =
  await smartAccountClient.dropAndReplaceUserOperation(request);
```

```ts [smartAccountClient.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/aa-core/smartAccountClient.ts]
```

## Returns

### `Promise<{ hash: Hash, request: UserOperationRequest }>`

A `Promise` containing the hash of the user operation request sent to the bundler with higher gas to be mined faster as the replacement of the input user operation request.

**Note**: The hash is not the User Operation Receipt. The user operation still needs to be bundled and included in a block. The user operation result is more of a proof of submission than a receipt.

## Parameters

### `DropAndReplaceUserOperationParameters<TAccount extends SmartContractAccount | undefined = SmartContractAccount | undefined>`

- `uoToDrop: UserOperationRequest`

A previously submitted `UserOperationRequest` to be dropped and replaced by a new user operation with higher gas to be mined faster

- `overrides?:` [`UserOperationOverrides`](/resources/types#useroperationoverrides)

Optional parameter where you can specify override values for `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `callGasLimit`, `preVerificationGas`, `verificationGasLimit`, `paymasterAndData`, or `nonceKey` for the user operation request

- `account?: TAccount extends SmartContractAccount | undefined`

When using this action, if the `SmartContractAccount` has not been connected to the `SmartAccountClient` (e.g. `SmartAccountClient` not instantiated with your `SmartContractAccount` during [`createSmartAccountClient`](/packages/aa-core/smart-account-client/)). You can check if the account is connected to the client by checking the `account` field of `SmartAccountClient`. If the account is not connected, you can specify the `SmartContractAccount` instance to use for the function call.
