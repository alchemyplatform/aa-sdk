# sendUserOperation

Sends a user operation or batch of user operations using the connected account. Before executing, sendUserOperation will run the user operation through the middleware pipeline.

Learn more about [`ClientMiddleware`](/packages/aa-core/smart-account-client/middleware/) to learn more about the internals of `SmartAccountClient` middleware pipeline that builds the user operation request given the user transaction call data and the operating account data.

## Usage

:::code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { smartAccountClient } from "./smartAccountClient";
// [!code focus:99]
// send single
smartAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    data: "0xCalldata",
    target: "0xTarget",
    value: 0n,
  },
});

// send batch

// NOTE: Not all Smart Contract Accounts support batching.
// The `SmartContractAccount` implementation must have the `encodeBatchExecute` method
// implemented for the `SmartAccountClient` to execute the batched user operation successfully.
smartAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
  uo: [
    {
      data: "0xCalldata",
      target: "0xTarget",
    },
    {
      data: "0xCalldata2",
      target: "0xTarget2",
      value: 1000n, // in wei
    },
  ],
});
```

```ts [smartAccountClient.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/aa-core/smartAccountClient.ts]
```

## Returns

### `Promise<{ hash: Hash, request: UserOperationRequest }>`

A `Promise` containing the hash of the user operation and the request that was sent.

**Note**: The hash is not the User Operation Receipt. The user operation still needs to be bundled and included in a block. The user operation result is more of a proof of submission than a receipt.
