# signUserOperation

Signs the unsigned `UserOperationStruct` returned from `buildUserOperation`, `buildUserOperationFromTx`, or `buildUserOperationFromTxs` actions of the `SmartAccountClient` using the account connected to the client.

## Usage

import BuildSignSendRawUo from "../../../../../snippets/aa-core/buildSignSendRawUserOp.mdx";

<BuildSignSendRawUo />

## Returns

### `Promise<{ hash: Hash, request: UserOperationRequest }>`

A `Promise` containing the signed result of the input `UserOperationStruct` using the account connected to the `SmartAccountClient`

## Parameters

### `SignUserOperationParameters<TAccount extends SmartContractAccount | undefined = SmartContractAccount | undefined>`

:::details[SignUserOperationParameters]

```ts
// [!include ~/../packages/core/src/actions/smartAccount/types.ts:SignUserOperationParameters]
```

:::

- `uoStruct: UserOperationStruct`

The unsigned `UserOperationStruct` returned from `buildUserOperation`, `buildUserOperationFromTx`, or `buildUserOperationFromTxs` actions of the `SmartAccountClient` returned after running the client middleware pipeline to construct the user operation struct from the input user operation calldata

- `account?: TAccount extends SmartContractAccount | undefined`

When using this action, if the `SmartContractAccount` has not been connected to the `SmartAccountClient` (e.g. `SmartAccountClient` not instantiated with your `SmartContractAccount` during [`createSmartAccountClient`](/packages/aa-core/smart-account-client/)). You can check if the account is connected to the client by checking the `account` field of `SmartAccountClient`. If the account is not connected, you can specify the `SmartContractAccount` instance to use for the function call.
