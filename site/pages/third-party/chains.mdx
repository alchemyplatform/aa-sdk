# AA only chains or non-Alchemy chains

If you're using a chain that isn't supported by us or we only support Account Abstraction methods for those chains, then you can use `createSmartAccountClient` or one of non-alchemy `create*Client` methods from `@account-kit/smart-contracts`
with a `split` transport to route your traffic accordingly.

## AA only chains example

```ts twoslash
import { createLightAccountClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import {
  createAlchemyPublicRpcClient,
  zora,
  alchemyFeeEstimator,
} from "@account-kit/infra";
import { split, LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { http, custom } from "viem";

const alchemyMethods = [
  "eth_sendUserOperation",
  "eth_estimateUserOperationGas",
  "eth_getUserOperationReceipt",
  "eth_getUserOperationByHash",
  "eth_supportedEntryPoints",
  "rundler_maxPriorityFeePerGas",
  "pm_getPaymasterData",
  "pm_getPaymasterStubData",
];

const alchemyBundlerClient = createAlchemyPublicRpcClient({
  // zora is an example of an aa only chain
  chain: zora,
  connectionConfig: {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});

const transport = split({
  overrides: [
    {
      methods: alchemyMethods,
      transport: custom(alchemyBundlerClient),
    },
  ],
  fallback: http("ZORA_NODE_RPC_URL"),
});

const smartAccountClient = createLightAccountClient({
  transport,
  chain: zora,
  feeEstimator: alchemyFeeEstimator(alchemyBundlerClient),
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.generatePrivateKeySigner(),
});
```

## Non-Alchemy chains example

To use non-Alchemy supported chains, you can use the `createSmartAccountClient` method from `@aa-sdk/core` or any of the non-Alchemy `create*Client` methods exported from `@account-kit/smart-contracts` with a `chain` definition for your chain and a `transport` pointing to your RPC provider.

See [`createSmartAccountClient`](/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/createSmartAccountClient) for more information.
