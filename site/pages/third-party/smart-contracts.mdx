# Using your own Smart Account

You are not limited to the accounts defined in `@account-kit/smart-contracts`.
If you'd like to bring your own smart account, you have a couple options:

1. Use a 3rd party library that exports an `aa-sdk` compatible `SmartContractAccount` interface.
1. Implement your own `SmartContractAccount` interface using `toSmartContractAccount`.

## Third Party SDKs

:::tip
If you've built an SDK or Guide that leverages any of the methods above to use as a Smart Contract within Account Kit, we're happy to include you in this list!

## Using `toSmartContractAccount`

The `SmartAccountClient` can be used with any smart account because it only relies on the `SmartContractAccount` interface. This means you can use your own smart account implementation with Account Kit.

```ts [my-account.ts] twoslash
import { getEntryPoint, toSmartContractAccount } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { http, type SignableMessage, type Hash } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const myAccount = await toSmartContractAccount({
  /// REQUIRED PARAMS ///
  source: "MyAccount",
  transport: http("RPC_URL"),
  chain: sepolia,
  // The EntryPointDef that your account is compatible with
  entryPoint: getEntryPoint(sepolia),
  // This should return a concatenation of your `factoryAddress` and the `callData` for your factory's create account method
  getAccountInitCode: async (): Promise<Hash> => "0x{factoryAddress}{callData}",
  // an invalid signature that doesn't cause your account to revert during validation
  getDummySignature: async (): Promise<Hash> => "0x1234...",
  // given a UO in the form of {target, data, value} should output the calldata for calling your contract's execution method
  encodeExecute: async (uo): Promise<Hash> => "0x....",
  signMessage: async ({ message }): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
  signTypedData: async (typedData): Promise<Hash> => "0x000",

  /// OPTIONAL PARAMS ///
  // if you already know your account's address, pass that in here to avoid generating a new counterfactual
  accountAddress: "0x...",
  // if your account supports batching, this should take an array of UOs and return the calldata for calling your contract's batchExecute method
  encodeBatchExecute: async (uos): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
  // if your contract expects a different signing scheme than the default signMessage scheme, you can override that here
  signUserOperationHash: async (hash): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
  // allows you to define the calldata for upgrading your account
  encodeUpgradeToAndCall: async (params): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
});
```

To use your account, you will need to pass it into a `SmartAccountClient`.

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { createAlchemySmartAccountClient, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { myAccount } from "./my-account";

const client = createAlchemySmartAccountClient({
  // created above
  account: myAccount,
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: alchemy({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  }),
});
```

```ts [my-account.ts] twoslash filename="my-account.ts"
import { getEntryPoint, toSmartContractAccount } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { http, type SignableMessage, type Hash } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

export const myAccount = await toSmartContractAccount({
  /// REQUIRED PARAMS ///
  source: "MyAccount",
  transport: http("RPC_URL"),
  chain: sepolia,
  // The EntryPointDef that your account is compatible with
  entryPoint: getEntryPoint(sepolia),
  // This should return a concatenation of your `factoryAddress` and the `callData` for your factory's create account method
  getAccountInitCode: async (): Promise<Hash> => "0x{factoryAddress}{callData}",
  // an invalid signature that doesn't cause your account to revert during validation
  getDummySignature: async (): Promise<Hash> => "0x1234...",
  // given a UO in the form of {target, data, value} should output the calldata for calling your contract's execution method
  encodeExecute: async (uo): Promise<Hash> => "0x....",
  signMessage: async ({ message }): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
  signTypedData: async (typedData): Promise<Hash> => "0x000",

  /// OPTIONAL PARAMS ///
  // if you already know your account's address, pass that in here to avoid generating a new counterfactual
  accountAddress: "0x...",
  // if your account supports batching, this should take an array of UOs and return the calldata for calling your contract's batchExecute method
  encodeBatchExecute: async (uos): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
  // if your contract expects a different signing scheme than the default signMessage scheme, you can override that here
  signUserOperationHash: async (hash): Promise<Hash> => "0x...",
  // allows you to define the calldata for upgrading your account

});

### `LightSmartContractAccount` as an Example

We have built an extension of the eth-infinitism `SimpleAccount` called [LightAccount.sol](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/src/LightAccount.sol). You can learn more about Light Account in the [Light Account documentation](/smart-contracts/light-account/).

We provide an implementation of `SmartContractAccount` that works with `LightAccount.sol`, which can be used as an example of how to implement your own Smart Contract Account:
:::details[LightSmartContractAccount]

```ts
// [!include ~/../account-kit/smart-contracts/src/light-account/accounts/account.ts]

### The `toSmartContractAccount` Method

For your reference, this is the definition of the `toSmartContractAccount` interface as pulled from the source code:

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/account/smartContractAccount.ts]
```
