# Modular Account V2 Overview

Alchemy's Modular Account V2 is the most robust and feature-rich smart account on the market with top-tier enterprise grade security. Being an ERC-6900 account, MAv2 can tap into a rich ecosystem of modules comprising different authentication methods like multisig or webauthn, as well as permissions and more!

With multiple developer-years of work and two comprehensive audits, MAv2 is the most advanced smart account available:

- 40%+ reduced gas costs
- Rich ecosystem of modules from teams like Circle
- Super simple & clean developer experience

## Cost

Cost matters, so gas optimization was essential throughout the whole development process. As a result, MAv2 is one of the most optimized smart contracts ever written.

As an example, see the gas comparison for deployment execution costs below:

|                                | **Execution gas for account creation** | **% More expensive than MAv2** |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Alchemy Modular Account v2** | **97,764**                             | -                                    |
| **ZeroDev Kernel v3**          | 180,465                                | 84.6%                                |
| **Safe**                       | 289,207                                | 195.8%                                |

We have a whole host of open-source benchmarks [here!](/smart-contracts/gas-benchmarks.mdx)

At scale, these optimizations could save tens of thousands of dollars in gas fees if not more-- all without compromising on features or security.

## Modularity

Along with Circle, Trust Wallet, Quantstamp and the Ethereum Foundation, we've already developed multiple plug & play modules for use with ERC-6900 accounts like MAv2. Out of the box, on the validation side, MAv2 supports session keys, Webauthn validation (passkeys/biometrics).

On the permissions front, MAv2 already has first-class support for the following:

- Allowlists, ensuring a validation can only access what you want it to and nothing else.
- ERC-20 spend limits, think session keys with spend limits!
- Native spend limits, which take gas into account.
- Enforcing expiries, so your session keys can last as short or as long as you need them to.

Note that these features are only possible thanks to the modular nature of ERC-6900, as they're all separate modules. This also means it's possible to combine any number of modules to perfectly fine-tune your permission set.

Want a session key that's only valid for 24 hours, can only spend up to 0.001 ETH (incl. gas) and 100 USDC, all the while it's only able to authenticate calls to one specific address with one specific function? Go for it!

## Simplicity

Regardless of how feature-rich MAv2 is, it's all for nothing if it's not easy to use. The account standard MAv2 adheres to has over 5,000 words-- it's understandably intimidating. However, the depth of ERC-6900 allows each feature in MAv2 to be secure and ultimately extremely simple for you, the developer.

Leveraging the standard's lack of ambiguity, aa-sdk can safely create high-level zero-cost abstractions, which translate down to RPC calls exactly how you expect them to. No more fighting with your tools. The sdk is designed from the ground up to get out of your way so you can focus on what matters-- building the best smart wallet experience for your app!
