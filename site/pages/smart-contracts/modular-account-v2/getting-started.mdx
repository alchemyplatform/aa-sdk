# Getting started with Modular Account V2

It is easy to get started with Modular Account V2! We will show you two different ways using Alchemy Infra or 3rd party infra.

## Install packages

**Prerequisites**

- minimum Typescript version of 5
- pin viem to 2.20.0 (`yarn add viem@2.20.0`)

**Installation**

First, install the `@account-kit/smart-contracts` package.

:::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/smart-contracts
# if using alchemy infra
yarn add @account-kit/infra
```

```bash [npm]
yarn add @account-kit/smart-contracts
# if using alchemy infra
yarn add @account-kit/infra
```

:::

## With Alchemy Infra

Then you can do the following:

```ts twoslash
import { createModularAccountV2Client } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

const alchemyAccountClient = await createModularAccountV2Client({
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
  chain: sepolia,
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
});
```

:::tip[Address calculation]
For Modular Account V2, the address of the smart account will be calculated as a combination of [the owner and the salt](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/modular-account/blob/v2.0.x/src/factory/AccountFactory.sol#L98-L104). You will get the same smart account address each time you supply the same `owner`, the signer(s) used to create the account for the first time. You can also optionally supply `salt` if you want a different address for the same `owner` param (the default salt is `0n`).

If you want to use a signer to connect to an account whose address does not map to the contract-generated address, you can supply the `accountAddress` to connect with the account of interest. In that case, the `signer` address is not used for address calculation, but only for signing the operation.

## With 3rd-party infra

If you're using a 3rd-party for infra, we also expose a client that you can use to interact with Modular Account V2 using other RPC providers.

```ts twoslash
import { createModularAccountV2Client } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { http } from "viem";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

const accountClient = await createModularAccountV2Client({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: http("RPC_URL"),
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
});
```

Next, if you want to use a different `signer` with a smart account signer, check out [choosing a signer](/signer/what-is-a-signer). Otherwise, if you are ready to get on-chain, go to [send user operations](/infra/send-user-operations).

## Sending a user operation

Now that you have a client, you can send a user operation with Modular Account V2.

```ts twoslash
const operation = await accountClient.sendUserOperation({
  target: "0x123..",
  data: "0x123..",
  value: "0n",
});
```
