# Upgrade Your Externally Owned Account (EOA) with EIP-7702

Externally-owned accounts (EOAs) are accounts that are only controlled by a private key or seed phrase, and are not smart contract accounts.

[EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) introduces a straightforward way for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to use smart contract code at their address. This is a major milestone in Ethereum’s account abstraction journey, enabling existing EOAs to benefit from functionality previously exclusive to smart accounts – such as batching actions, sponsored transactions, and more.

With [Account Kit](https://accountkit.alchemy.com) from Alchemy, you can integrate this upgrade path directly into your app or wallet. Users will seamlessly enjoy advanced features like multi-call batching, session keys, and gas sponsorship, with the convenience of using existing account addresses and without asset migrations.

Below, we’ll walk you through:

- When to use EIP-7702
- How to use EIP-7702 with Account Kit
- Signer requirements
- Using EIP-7702 in practice
- When EIP-7702 will be available

## When to Use EIP-7702?

EIP-7702 is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. You have an app using embedded wallets with EOA accounts
2. You have a wallet using EOA accounts

You can upgrade your users' EOA accounts directly to a smart account at their current address. This means you don’t have to move assets.

#### Gain Smart Account Features

By upgrading to a smart account, you immediately unlock features such as:

- **Batching actions**: Execute multiple operations in a single transaction.
- **Gas sponsorship**: Let your users pay zero gas by using sponsored transactions, or use custom paymaster contracts that allow you to pay gas in other tokens.
- **Custom session keys**: Provide temporary keys to interact with your app without exposing your primary signer, allowing you to skip transaction confirmations.

## How to Use EIP-7702

Account Kit provides **Modular Account V2**, which is an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compliant account that you can upgrade EOAs to with EIP-7702. It also supports installing [ERC-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) modules.

To use EIP-7702 with Account Kit, you can simply create a smart account client for Modular Account V2 with `mode` set to `"7702"`. Account Kit will automatically handles the upgrade from the regular EOA to the 7702-delegated smart EOA.

## Signer Requirements

To use EIP-7702, you need a signer that generate authorization signature. Typically, this is implemented as a method called `signAuthorization`.

### Out-of-the-Box Support in Account Kit

**Alchemy Signer**

If you’re using Alchemy Signer, it already supports signing EIP-7702 authorizations. This means you can handle upgrades seamlessly for your users, either via Account Kit’s React hooks in `@account-kit/react` or with the low-level package `@account-kit/smart-contracts`.

Please follow either the [React guide](/react/overview) or the [Signer guide](/signer/overview), making sure to use Modular Account V2 with `mode` set to `"7702"`.

**Local Signer**

Use a local account signer if you are integrating with a locally managed private key (e.g. you are a self-custodial wallet).

:::note
Note: viem requires that you generate a [Private Key account](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet#local-accounts-private-key-mnemonic-etc) to use `signAuthorization`, meaning you cannot use Mnemonic accounts or Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) accounts yet.
:::

```ts [types.ts] twoslash
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";

const privateKey = "0x..."; // Private key

const signer = LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(privateKey);
```

### Using Third Party Signers

If you have a custom signer or another third-party provider, you'll need to verify that it supports `signAuthorization`, and connect it to Account Kit.

Follow the guide here to understand how to implement the interface: [Third Party Signers](/third-party/signers#implementing-smartaccountauthenticator-or-smartaccountsigner).

In most cases, you should be able to pass the arguments through to the inner signer.

## Using EIP-7702

Oonce your account type and signer is configured, you're ready to use EIP-7702!

- The smary account client will automatically detect if your account is not yet delegated with 7702 when you send a user operation.
  - If it is not yet delegated, it will request an authorization signature and include that in the submitted user operation.
- The Alchemy ERC-4337 bundler will automatically include the EIP-7702 authorization with the first user op that your account performs.

:::code-group

```ts [example.ts] twoslash
import { createModularAccountV2Client } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { signer } from "./signer.js";

// Constructing the smart account client
const smartAccountClient = await createModularAccountV2Client({
  mode: "7702",
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
  chain: sepolia,
  signer,
});

// Sending a user operation
const uoHash = await smartAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: zeroAddress,
    value: 0n,
    data: "0x",
  },
});

const txnHash = await smartAccountClient.waitForUserOperationTransaction(
  uoHash
);
```

```ts twoslash [signer.ts] filename="signer.ts"
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";

const privateKey = "0x...";

export const signer = LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(privateKey);
```

## When can I use it?

EIP-7702 will be supported on Sepolia starting March 5. The Alchemy bundler and Account Kit will have day-one support. Mainnet support is expected to follow shortly after.

Check out the [UI Demo](https://demo.alchemy.com) to see a live preview of these features in action!
