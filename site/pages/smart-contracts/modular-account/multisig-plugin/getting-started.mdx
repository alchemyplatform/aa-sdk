# Getting started with the Multisig Plugin

## 1. Create a Multisig Account Client

Initialize a Multisig Modular Account client and set the `n` accounts as signers.

:::warning
It is recommended to use the `createMultisigAccountAlchemyClient` directly to create new accounts with multi-sig ownership, rather than extending the Modular Account client.

If you have an existing Modular Account (which has multi-owner plugin by default), please see details [here](#TODO/smart-contracts/extending-smart-accounts/install-plugins#extend-modular-account-with-multisig) for installing the plugin before proceeding.
:::

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/smart-contracts/multisig-client.ts]
```

## 3. Propose a User Operation

To propose a new user operation for review by the multisig signers, you will use the `proposeUserOperation` method. This estimates gas, constructs the user operation struct, and if `gasManagerConfig` is used then it attempts to use a paymaster. Lastly, a signature is generated with the pre-provided signer.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { multisigAccountClient } from "./client";
import { createMultisigAccountAlchemyClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";

const {
  request,
  aggregatedSignature,
  signatureObj: firstSig,
} = await multisigAccountClient.proposeUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: targetAddress,
    data: "0x",
  },
});
```

```ts twoslash [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/smart-contracts/multisig-client.ts]
```

:::

## 4. Get the threshold signatures

Next, you have to collect the next k-2 signatures, excluding the first signature which you already provided and the last signature which we'll deal with in step 5 when we send the user operation. Each member of the multisig can sign with the `signMultisigUserOperation` method.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { createMultisigAccountAlchemyClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { signers, owners, threshold } from "./client";

const multisigAccountClient = await createMultisigAccountAlchemyClient({
  chain,
  signer: signers[1], // using the second signer
  owners,
  threshold,
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const { aggregatedSignature, signatureObj: secondSig } =
  await multisigAccountClient.signMultisigUserOperation({
    account: multisigAccountClient.account,
    // output from step 1, and from this step if k-2 > 1
    signatures: [previousAggregatedSignature],
    userOperationRequest: request,
  });
```

```ts twoslash [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/smart-contracts/multisig-client.ts]
```

:::

## 5. Send the User Operation

After collecting k-1 signatures, you're ready to collect the last signature and send the user operation. This is done with the `sendUserOperation` method. `sendUserOperation` also formats this aggregated signature, sorting its parts in ascending order by owner address as expected by the Multisig Plugin smart contract.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { createMultisigAccountAlchemyClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { signers, owners, threshold } from "./client";

const multisigAccountClient = await createMultisigAccountAlchemyClient({
  chain,
  // using the last signer
  signer: signers[2],
  owners,
  threshold,
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const result = await multisigAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
  uo: request.callData,
  context: {
    aggregatedSignature,
    signatures: [firstSig, secondSig],
    userOpSignatureType: "ACTUAL",
  },
});
```

```ts twoslash [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/smart-contracts/multisig-client.ts]
```

:::

By default, we use the variable gas feature in the Multisig Plugin smart contract. For this, we need `userOpSignatureType` to be set to "ACTUAL". If you do not wish to use this feature, gas overrides should be passed in `sendUserOperation`, and `userOpSignatureType` should be set to "UPPERLIMIT".

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { multisigAccountClient } from "./client";

const result = await multisigAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
  uo: request.callData,
  overrides: {
    callGasLimit: request.callGasLimit,
    verificationGasLimit: request.verificationGasLimit,
    preVerificationGas: request.preVerificationGas,
    maxFeePerGas: request.maxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: request.maxPriorityFeePerGas,
  },
  context: {
    aggregatedSignature,
    signatures: [firstSig, secondSig],
    userOpSignatureType: "UPPERLIMIT",
  },
});
```

```ts twoslash [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/smart-contracts/multisig-client.ts]
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You've initialized a modular account with three multisig members, proposed a user operation, collected the necessary signatures, and sent the user operation to the bundler.
