# default7702UserOpSigner

Provides a default middleware function for signing user operations with a client account when using ERC-7702 to upgrade local accounts to smart accounts.
If the SmartAccount doesn't support `signAuthorization`, then this just runs the default UserOpSigner middleware

## Import

```ts
import { default7702UserOpSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
```

## Parameters

### struct

`UserOperationStruct`
The user operation structure to be signed

### params

`*`
The middleware context containing the client and account information

### params.client

`Client`
The client object, which should include account and chain information

### params.account

`Account`
Optional, the account used for signing, defaults to the client's account if not provided

## Returns

`Promise<UserOperationStruct>`
A promise that resolves to the signed user operation structure
