# useSigner

[Hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSigner.ts) for accessing the current Alchemy signer within a React component. It uses a synchronous external store for updates.
This is a good use case if you want to use the signer as an EOA, giving you direct access to it. The signer returned from `useSigner` just does a `personal_sign` or `eth_signTypedData` without any additional logic, but a smart contract account might have additional logic for creating signatures for 1271 validation so `useSignMessage` or `useSignTypeData` instead.

## Import

```ts
import { useSigner } from "@account-kit/react-native";
```

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { useSigner } from "@account-kit/react";
import type { AlchemyWebSigner } from "@account-kit/signer";

const signer: AlchemyWebSigner | null = useSigner();
```

## Returns

`AlchemyWebSigner | null`
The current Alchemy signer or null if none is available. [ref](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/signer/src/client/index.ts#L50)
