# initOauth

Prepares the config . This is recommended to be called on page load as it is required for popup-based oauth login and email login.

This method exists because browsers may prevent popups from opening unless
triggered by user interaction, and so the OAuth config must already have
been fetched at the time a user clicks a social login button.

## Import

```ts
import { BaseAlchemySigner } from "@account-kit/signer";
```

## Usage

```ts
import { AlchemyWebSigner } from "@account-kit/signer";

const signer = new AlchemyWebSigner({
  client: {
    connection: {
      rpcUrl: "/api/rpc",
    },
    iframeConfig: {
      iframeContainerId: "alchemy-signer-iframe-container",
    },
  },
});

await signer.initOauth();
```

## Returns

`Promise<OauthConfig>`
the oauth config as fetched from signer service
