# signRawMessage

This will sign a message with the user's private key, without doing any transformations on the message.
For SignMessage or SignTypedData, the caller should hash the message before calling this method and pass
that result here.

## Import

```ts
import { BaseSignerClient } from "@account-kit/signer";
```

## Parameters

### msg

`Hex`
the hex representation of the bytes to sign

## Returns

`Promise<Hex>`
the signature over the raw hex
