# isAlchemyTransport

A type guard for the transport to determine if it is an Alchemy transport.
Used in cases where we would like to do switching depending on the transport, where there used
to be two clients for a alchemy and a non alchemy, and with this switch we don't need the two separate clients. \*

## Import

```ts
import { isAlchemyTransport } from "@account-kit/infra";
```

## Parameters

### transport

`Transport`
The transport to check

### chain

`Chain`
Chain for the transport to run its function to return the transport config

## Returns

`boolean`
`true` if the transport is an Alchemy transport, otherwise `false`
