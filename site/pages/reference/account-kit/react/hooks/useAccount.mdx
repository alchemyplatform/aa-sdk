# [useAccount](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useAccount.ts)

Hook to subscribe to account state and interactions, including creation, connection, and status monitoring. It synchronizes with external store updates and provides status-dependent results.
The supported account types are: LightAccount, MultiOwnerLightAccount, and MultiOwnerModularAccount.

Primarily used to get the smart account address before deployment. Dependent on the signer, if the signer has not been initialized and authenticated, address and isLoadingAccount return null.

If using a smart contract account, returns instance of a smart contract account that the user is connected to. Returns address of smart contract account, not address of the signer
If using an EOA, returns address of signer
