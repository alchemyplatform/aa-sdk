# useAccount

[Hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useAccount.ts) to subscribe to account state and interactions, including creation, connection, and status monitoring. It synchronizes with external store updates and provides status-dependent results.
The supported account types are: LightAccount, MultiOwnerLightAccount, and MultiOwnerModularAccount. Primarily used to get the smart account address before deployment. Dependent on the signer: if the signer has not been initialized and authenticated, `address` and `isLoadingAccount` return null.

If using a smart contract account, returns instance of a smart contract account that the user is connected to. Returns address of smart contract account, not address of the signer.

If using an EOA, returns address of signer

## Usage
