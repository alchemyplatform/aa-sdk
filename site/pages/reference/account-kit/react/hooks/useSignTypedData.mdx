# useSignTypedData

Similar to `useSignMessage`, [hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSignTypedData.ts) for signing typed data, supporting both connected accounts and clients in EIP 712 format.

Uses `eth_signTypedData` to sign structured, typed data. Accepts typed, complex data structures as input. Like `useSignMessage`, this hook also handles deployed (1271) and undeployed accounts (6492).

## Import

```ts
import { useSignTypedData } from "@account-kit/react";
```

## Usage

```ts
import { useSignTypedData, useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({ type: "LightAccount" });
const {
  signTypedData,
  signTypedDataAsync,
  signedTypedData,
  isSigningTypedData,
  error,
} = useSignTypedData({
  client,
  // these are optional
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    // do something on success
  },
  onError: (error) => console.error(error),
});
```
