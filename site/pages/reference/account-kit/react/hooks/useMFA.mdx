# useMFA

[Hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useMFA.ts) that provides functions and state for managing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) operations.
Handles adding, verifying, removing, and checking MFA status for an authenticated account.

The hook checks if the signer is connected before allowing MFA operations and provides an `isMfaAvailable` flag
to indicate whether MFA operations can be performed.

## Import

```ts
import { useMFA } from "@account-kit/react";
```

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { useMFA } from "@account-kit/react";

const {
  addMFA,

  getMFAFactors,
  isAddingMFA,
  isVerifyingMFA,
  isRemovingMFA,
  isGettingFactors,
  isMfaAvailable,
  error,
} = useMFA();
```

An object containing functions and state for handling MFA operations
