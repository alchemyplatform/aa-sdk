```

## Usage

```ts
import { installPlugin, createModularAccountAlchemyClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";

const client = createModularAccountAlchemyClient(...);

const hash = await installPlugin(client, {
pluginAddress: "0x...",
manifestHash: "0x...",
dependencies: [], // this is defined by the plugin you're installing
});
```

## Parameters

### client

`Client<TTransport, TChain, TAccount>`
The client configured to the smart account on which the plugin will be installed

### params

`InstallPluginParams<TAccount, TContext>`
The parameters required to install the plugin, including overrides, context, and account information

## Returns
