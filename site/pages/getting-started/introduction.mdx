# Quick start app

You can build seamless web3 user onboarding experiences with Embedded Accounts.

To help you get started, this quick start will focus on a starter application with a codebase designed to be simple so you can easily see how it works.

It will be broken into three sections:

1. **Demo**: Jump into the starter app as a user
2. **Run locally**: Clone the starter app and run it for yourself
3. **Walkthrough**: Take a closer look at the key points of integration

## Demo

Want to try it out as a user? Jump into this [live demo](https://embedded-accounts-quickstart.vercel.app/).

Or, watch this screen capture to see the experience:

In this app each user is provided a smart account tied to their email address. Every onchain action is gas-sponsored so the user can start minting tokens at the click of a button!

Excited to run it yourself? Move to the next step to [run the starter app](/getting-started/run-locally) or jump ahead to [learn how it works](/getting-started/walkthrough).
