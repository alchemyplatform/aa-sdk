This guide will show you how to create Embedded Accounts using [Account Kit](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#account-kit), the Alchemy [Signer](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#signer), and the Alchemy [Modular Account](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#modular-account).

:::tip[Want to test it out right away?]
Clone [this Github repo](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart) and follow the `README`.

By the end of this guide, you will have set up a basic web application where users sign up with email, silently deploy a Modular Account onchain, and send UserOperations (UOs) with zero gas using the Alchemy [Rundler](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#bundler) and Alchemy [Gas Manager](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms#gas-manager).

Here's a demo video below of the experience you'll be building!
