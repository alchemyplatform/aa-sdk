# Run locally

Now that you have seen the starter app, its time to get it running locally for yourself! This section will walk you have you clone, configure and run the starter app.

## Clone the repository

First you can clone the repository with any of these commands:

:::code-group

```bash [https]
git clone https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart.git
```

```bash [ssh]
git clone git@github.com:alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart.git
```

```bash [github cli]
gh repo clone alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart
```

:::

Additionally, you can find the starter app on Github here: https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart

## Setup your environment variables

You'll notice that on Github, there is a [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart/blob/main/.env.sample) file. Create a copy of this file and call it `.env`. This is where all of your environment variables will go to interact with Alchemy services.

Next, we'll fill out that `.env` with variables. You will create an Alchemy API key, an Embedded Accounts Config, and a Gas Manager Policy. You will use these to send UOs, authenticate logins, and sponsor gas respectively.

### Alchemy API Key

The Alchemy API Key will allow you to read and write to blockchains through Alchemy's reliable infrastructure. In this context, the API Key will let you create Embedded Accounts onchain for your users, and send UserOperations on behalf of those accounts.

To create an API Key, go to https://dashboard.alchemy.com, sign up for an account, and go through the onboarding. Then on the [apps](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps/?a=embedded-accounts-get-started) page, click "Create new app" button.

When configuring the Alchemy app, select Arbitrum Sepolia for the network.

Click the API Key button in the top right corner and copy-paste it into the `.env` file of your application as an environment variable called `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`.

### Alchemy Embedded Accounts Config

The Embedded Accounts Config enables [magic link authentication](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/resources/terms.html#magic-link-authentication) on your app's domain by configuring the Alchemy Signer, which securely stores the user's private key in a non-custodial [secure enclave](https://docs.turnkey.com/security/our-approach). It is responsible for authenticating a user via email or passkey using this config, managing a user's session, and signing messages to send UserOperations. Check out the [AlchemySigner docs](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/packages/aa-alchemy/signer/overview.html) for more details.

To create an Embedded Accounts Config, go to the [embedded accounts page](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts/?a=embedded-accounts-get-started) of the Alchemy dashboard and click the “New account config” button.

  alt="Accounts Config Create"
/>

Then:

1. Name your config.
2. Set `http://localhost:3000` as the redirect URL. NextJS apps by default are hosted locally at port 3000, and you will want to direct the user back to the URL where your application is hosted to authenticate them.
3. [optional] Customize the logo, “Sign In” button color, and support URL of the email.

  alt="Accounts Config Configure 1"
/>

Next, apply this config to the Alchemy App you created in the previous step. Doing this will allow you send requests to Alchemy Signer via the Account Kit SDKs you will install in the next step.

### Alchemy Gas Manager Policy

The Gas Manager Policy defines a config for Alchemy's ERC-4337 Paymaster implementation, allowing you to sponsor your users' gas fees. To learn more about Paymasters, check out Alchemy's [blog post](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster).

To create a Gas Manager Policy, go to the [gas manager](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager?a=embedded-accounts-get-started) page of the Alchemy dashboard and click the “Create new policy” button.

<img
  src="/images/getting-started/gas-manager-create.png"
  alt="Gas Manager Create"
/>

Then:

1. Name your policy.
2. Associate the policy with the Alchemy App you created in the last step by selecting it in the “Policy details” section.
3. Select the default configurations for the remaining sections.

<img
  src="/images/getting-started/gas-manager-configure.png"
  alt="Gas Manager Configure"
/>

Once you create the policy, copy the Policy ID below the policy's header and copy-paste it into the .env file of your application as an environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID`.

## Run the app

Now it's time to run the app! You will need to install the dependencies and then kickoff the development server.

To do this, we recommend using the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager so you will make use of the lock file we have committed to the repository and ensure you have the same library versions as we did.

Run the app with three steps:

1. Open a terminal to the location of your repository
2. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
3. Run the development server with `yarn dev`

And that's it! Your app should now be running on your [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

Be sure to check out the code and modify it to your satisfaction. And once you're ready to look closer, jump into the next section [learn how it all works](./how-it-works.md).
