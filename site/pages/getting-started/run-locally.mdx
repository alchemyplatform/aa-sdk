# Run locally

Now that you have seen the starter app, its time to get it running locally for yourself! This section will walk you have you clone, configure and run the starter app.

## Clone the repository

First you can clone the repository with any of these commands:

:::code-group

```bash [https]
git clone https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart.git
```

```bash [ssh]
git clone git@github.com:alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart.git
```

```bash [github cli]
gh repo clone alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart
```

:::

Additionally, you can find the starter app on Github here: https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart

## Setup your environment variables

You'll notice that on Github, there is a [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart/blob/main/.env.sample) file. Create a copy of this file and call it `.env`. This is where all of your environment variables will go to interact with Alchemy services.

Next, we'll fill out that `.env` with variables.

### Embedded Accounts

To get started with embedded accounts, you'll first need to sign up for an alchemy account at https://dashboard.alchemy.com/.

Once you're on the dashboard, it is super easy to get started!

:::tip
If this is not your first time setting up an embedded accounts config, you can create a new app [here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps), setup a gas policy [here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager), and an embedded accounts config [here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts).
:::

First click **Embedded Accounts** on your sidebar, then **Get Started** as shown below.

Next you'll be greeted with a dialog, where you can get your **API Key**, for interacting with blockchains, and your **Gas Policy ID**, for sponsoring transactions.

You can click on the copy button to copy these variables to your clipboard. Fill them out in your `.env` as shown in the [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart/blob/main/.env.sample) file.

:::tip
This process quickly setup three different things which you can always configure further later on:

1. API Key ([here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)): Your authentication key to manage requests to blockchains
2. Gas Policy ID ([here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager)): Your gas policy to sponsor transactions for users
3. Accounts Configuration ([here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)): Your application settings for embedded account logins

## Run the app

Now it's time to run the app! You will need to install the dependencies and then kickoff the development server.

To do this, we recommend using the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager so you will make use of the lock file we have committed to the repository and ensure you have the same library versions as we did.

Run the app with three steps:

1. Open a terminal to the location of your repository
2. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
3. Run the development server with `yarn dev`

And that's it! Your app should now be running on your [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

Be sure to check out the code and modify it to your satisfaction. And once you're ready to look closer, jump into the next section [learn how it all works](/getting-started/walkthrough).
