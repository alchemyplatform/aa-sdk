# Walkthrough

It's time to learn how it all works! We recommend opening the [starter app repository](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart) and walking through the components below to understand how it integrates Embedded Accounts.

## 1. The config

First, let's do our configuration in a [file](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/embedded-accounts-quickstart/blob/main/src/config.ts) called `config.ts`.

```ts [/src/config.ts]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/config.ts:create-accounts-config]
```

Let's take note of three things in this configuration:

1. First you'll notice we chose a specific chain definition here. You can change the `chain` variable and expect this to be reflected everywhere in the application.
2. You'll also notice the `rpcUrl` points to API endpoints in our app. By doing this, the application does not expose the API key client side. We specify two different endpoints for the [Alchemy Signer](/signers/alchemy-signer/introduction) and general chain RPC calls to keep the behavior consistent with an Alchemy API endpoint.
3. Lastly you'll notice we set Server Side Rendering (`ssr`) to be true for consistent behavior on the client/server in SSR apps. You can learn more about SSR [here](/react/ssr).

We set a few additional variables in the configuration so that we can refer to them throughout the application, see them here:

:::details[Additional config]

```ts [/src/config.ts]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/config.ts:other-config-vars]
```

:::

## 2. Setting up the provider

We're almost up to fun the part! There's just a bit more we need to do to setup our global context so we can use our react hooks everywhere.

First, we'll setup our initial client state in our root layout:

```tsx [/src/app/layout.tsx]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/app/layout.tsx:root-layout]
```

This `initialState` is, again, related to [SSR](/react/ssr).

And in the `Providers`, we'll make use of this initial state:

```tsx [/src/app/providers.tsx]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/app/providers.tsx:providers]
```

Once we wrap the app in a configured `AlchemyAccountProvider`, we're all set to use account kit [react hooks](/react/overview) throughout our application!

## 3. Initial render

On the initial render of the application we'll want to know whether the user is already connected. We can make use of the [useSignerStatus](/react/useSignerStatus) hook for this:

```tsx [/src/app/page.tsx]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/app/page.tsx:using-status]
```

In this case, if the user is connected we render the `ProfileCard`, or else we move to the `LoginCard`. Let's take a peek at the key parts of those two components next!

## 4. Authenticating (`LoginCard`)

In the `LoginCard`, we can create a nice UI to capture the user's email. We can make use of the [useAuthenticate](/react/useAuthenticate) hook for kicking off the email authentication, and [useSignerStatus](/react/useSignerStatus) again for checking to see if we kicked off that process.

```tsx [/src/components/login-card.tsx]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/components/login-card.tsx:authenticating]
```

## 5. Send the user operation (`ProfileCard`)

Once the user is connected, we can send a user operation!

For this part, we can collect whatever information we need from the user to figure out what parameters to fill in the user operation. In this application we allow the user to specify the `target` address, the `data` to send to the address, as well as the `value` to send.

We'll get a `client` by using [useSmartAccountClient](/react/useSmartAccountClient) with values provided from our config. Then we'll pass this `client` to [useSendUserOperation](/react/useSendUserOperation) which will provide us everything we need to know about the operations status.

```tsx [/src/components/profile-card.tsx]
// [!include ~/../examples/embedded-accounts-quickstart/src/components/profile-card.tsx:sending-user-op]
```

## Wrap up

That's everything for this quick start! And yet, there's still so much more to discover.

In this section we went over how to use just a few of the react hooks that are available to you in your application. If you would like to learn more about all the different react hooks that are available, go to the [react hooks overview](/react/overview).

We also touched on the Alchemy Signer, as the key service that allows you to use embedded accounts. If you would like to learn more about how to use passkeys, configuring the user session or exporting private keys, go to the [alchemy signer introduction](/signers/alchemy-signer/introduction).
