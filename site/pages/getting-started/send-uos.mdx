# Send UserOperations

In this last section, you will enable users to send UserOperations through their newly created Embedded Account on your app.

## Add button to Send UserOperations

Add a new `src/components/SendUOButton.tsx` file and incorporate it onto the `src/components/ProfileCard.tsx` for authenticated users to send a UO. These files should now look as follows:

:::code-group

```tsx [src/components/ProfileCard.tsx]
// [!include ~/snippets/getting-started/send-uos/ProfileCard.tsx]
```

```tsx [src/components/SendUOButton.tsx]
// [!include ~/snippets/getting-started/send-uos/SendUOButton.tsx]
```

:::

That's it! At this point, run the application using:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

:::

You've now enabled users to sendUOs from their Embedded Account on your application, and the experience should look like the video below!

Congratulations! Using Account Kit, the Alchemy Signer, and Alchemy Modular Account, you created an application that authenticates a user by email to create their Embedded Account, and then uses that account to send a UserOperation!
