# Offchain Policy Configuration

**Offchain policies** are a set of rules enforced by our secure wallet infrastructure that define the allowed or denied transactions on a smart wallet.

An offchain policy is defined by the following schema:

```tsx
type Policy = {
	version: "1.0";
	// Allows you to assign a human readable name
	// for your policy
	name: string;
	vm_kind: "EVM" | "SVM";
	// This is the account that this policy targets
	account: string;
	// This is the list of rules that will be enforced
	// when the policy is evaluated
	// The supported rules differ based on the network
	rules: Rule[];
}
```

## Rules

A rule defines the specific conditions that must be met for a given Wallet API method.

```tsx
type Rule = {
	name: string;
	type: "methods",
	action: "ALLOW" | "DENY";
	method:
		// https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/758
		| "wallet_prepareCalls"
		| "wallet_sendPreparedCalls" 
		| "signAndSendTransaction" // SVM
		| "sendTransaction"; // SVM
	conditions: Condition[];
} | {
	type: "recipients",
	action: "ALLOW" | "DENY",
	address: string[],
} | {
	type: "contracts",
	action: "ALLOW" | "DENY",
	address: string[],
}
```

## Conditions

Conditions give you the flexibility to compose multiple requirements that must be met for a given Rule. All conditions must be met in order for the Rule to be enforced.

```tsx
type Condition = {
	type: "field";
	// This specifies where to evaluate the condition
	// for EVM. `call` gives you the most flexibility
	// on enforcement.
	field_source: 
		| "call" // EVM only
		| "user_operation" // EVM only
		| "solana_transaction" // Solana only
		| "solana_instruction" // Solana only
		| "spl_transaction"; // Solana only
	field: string;
	// should only be set when the field_source is `call`
	// and field is `data`
	abi?: JSON;
	comparator: 
		| '==' 
		| '!=' 
		| '<' 
		| '<=' 
		| '>' 
		| '>=' 
		| 'in';
	// the value to compare the field against
	value: string | number | string[];
} | {
	type: "batch_value",
	max_batch_value: string;
} | {
	type: "gas_limit",
	max_gas_limit: string;
}
```

The following Fields are supported for a given `field_source`

| Field Source | Supported Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `call`  | `to`, `data`, `value` |
| `user_operation`  | The fields here are all of the fields that are defined in a User Operation Request that would be submitted to the bundler. This depends on the EntryPoint version. Most Conditions can be defined by using the above `call` source instead though. This field_source is useful for enforcing gas limits, fee limits, etc |
| `solana_transaction` | Any of the fields that are included in a Solana Transaction |
| `solana_instruction`  | Any of the fields defined in a Solana instruction |
| `spl_transaction`  | When a Solana transaction is detected to include an SPL token transaction, this allows enforcing the token transaction based on the `spl_transfer_recipient`, `spl_transfer_value`, `spl_token_address` |
