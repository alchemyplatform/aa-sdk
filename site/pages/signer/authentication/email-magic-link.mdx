# Email Magic Link Authentication

Email magic link authentication allows you to login and signup users using an email address. Your users will receive a link in their inbox which will redirect them to your site (configured in the dashboard) to complete login.

:::tip
For setting up an account config, see the [Signer Quickstart](/signer/quickstart).

## Authenticate a user

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

// send the email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  email: "user@mail.com",
});

// later once the user has clicked the link
const url = new URL(window.location.href);
const bundle = url.searchParams.get("bundle");
if (!bundle) {
  throw new Error("No bundle found in URL");
}

await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  bundle,
});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```
