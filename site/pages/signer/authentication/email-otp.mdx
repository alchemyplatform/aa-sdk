# Email OTP Authentication

Email OTP authentication allows you to log in and sign up users using an email address. Your users will receive six-digit code in their inbox which they can enter in your site to complete login.

:::tip
For setting up an account config, see the [Signer Quickstart](/signer/quickstart).

## Authenticate a user

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

// send the email
// Promise resolves when the user is fully authenticated (OTP + optional MFA),
// even if final step completes in another tab/window
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  emailMode: "otp",
  email: "user@mail.com",
});

// later once the user has entered the code from their email

// Promise resolves when the user is fully authenticated (OTP + optional MFA),
// even if final step completes in another tab/window
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "otp",
  otpCode: "123456",
});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```

### Track Authentication Status

Use `signer.on("statusChanged", callback)` and the `AlchemySignerStatus` enum to respond to OTP/MFA prompts and completion:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";
import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

signer.on("statusChanged", (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_EMAIL_AUTH:
      // show OTP input UI
      break;
    case AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_MFA_AUTH:
      // show TOTP input UI
      break;
    case AlchemySignerStatus.CONNECTED:
      // authentication complete
      break;
  }
});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```
