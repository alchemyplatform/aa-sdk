# Social Login Authentication

Email magic link authentication allows you to login and signup users using an Oauth provider, such as Google Sign-In or Facebook Login. You can also configure custom providers through Auth0.

:::tip
For setting up an account config, see the [Signer Quickstart](/signer/quickstart).
