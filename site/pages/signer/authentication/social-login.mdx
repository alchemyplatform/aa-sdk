# Social Login Authentication

Social login authentication allows you to login and signup users using an OAuth provider, such as Google Sign-In or Facebook Login. You can also configure custom providers through Auth0.

:::tip
To set up configurations to enable social login, see the [Signer Quickstart](/signer/quickstart) to enable a social policy in the dashboard.
