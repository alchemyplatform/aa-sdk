# Types

## `BatchUserOperationCallData`

An array of `UserOperationCallData`, representing a sequence of `UserOperations` to be executed in batch by calling the `executeBatch` function on the `SmartContractAccount` contract. Check out our guide on [How to submit batch transactions](#TODO/using-smart-accounts/batch-user-operations) to learn more about batching multiple transactions into a single `UserOperation`.

:::details[BatchUserOperationCallData]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts:BatchUserOperationCallData]
```

:::

## `BigNumberish`

A type that can be a hexadecimal string prefixed with [`Hex`](https://viem.sh/docs/glossary/types#hex), a `bigint`, or a `number`. It is used to represent values that can be converted to or operate as big integers.

:::details[BigNumberish]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/utils/schema.ts:BigNumberish]
```

:::

## `BigNumberishRange`

An object type that may contain optional `min` and `max` fields, each of which accepts a `BigNumberish` value. This type is used to specify a numerical range, including both the minimum and maximum bounds.

:::details[BigNumberishRange]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/utils/schema.ts:BigNumberishRange]
```

:::

## `BundlerAction`

Bundler Actions are `viem` [`Actions`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/introduction) that map one-to-one with "public" [`Bundler`](./terms#bundler) RPC methods (`eth_sendUserOperation`, `eth_getUserOperationByHash`, etc.) under the [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) and [EIP-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) standards. They are used with a [`BundlerClient`](#bundlerclient). `BundlerActions` do not require any special permissions, nor do they provide "signing" capabilities to the user. Examples of `BundlerActions` include retrieving the details of a specific user operation, estimating user operation gas, etc.

:::details[BundlerAction]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/client/decorators/bundlerClient.ts:BundlerActions]
```

:::

## `BundlerClient`

`BundlerClient` is a custom `viem` [`Client`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/custom) we have built our own, where we extended viem's [`PublicClient`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) with [`BundlerActions`](#bundleraction), which are `Actions` that provide custom functionalities of [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) and [EIP-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) standards. `BundlerClient` is an intermediary or connector that enables client applications to interact with the [`Bundler`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#definitions) that you are using. `BundlerClient`, because it extends `PublicClient`, supports [`Public Actions`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/introduction) for client applications to connect, query, and interact with the blockchain (i.e., sending transactions, smart contract executions, data retrieval, etc.).

:::details[BundlerClient]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/client/bundlerClient.ts:BundlerClient]
```

:::

## `ClientMiddleware`

Middleware represents different operations involved in the [`SmartAccountClient`](/concepts/smart-account-client) pipeline for constructing a user operation given the user inputs by populating the UO with other data, including gas fees, paymaster data, etc.

:::details[ClientMiddleware]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/middleware/types.ts:ClientMiddleware]
```

:::

## `ClientMiddlewareConfig`

Configuration object to configure `ClientMiddleware` of the [`SmartAccountClient`](/concepts/smart-account-client) during the client instantiation. You can configure using this object to configure the middleware of your interest selectively.

:::details[ClientMiddlewareFn]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/client/types.ts:ClientMiddlewareConfig]
```

:::

## `ClientMiddlewareFn`

Each middleware is a function that takes in a user operation object, `UserOperationStruct`, performs its job to retrieve or compute the data, and populate different fields of the user operation to pass onto the next middleware in the pipeline before being signed and sent to the network. `ClientMiddlewareFn` is the function type that represents each middleware. In optional [`UserOperationOverrides`](#useroperationoverrides), and [`UserOperationFeeOptions`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/v4.x.x/aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#L55), and returns a promise that resolves to a modified `UserOperationStruct`. This function is what you specify as your overridden middleware value for applying custom logic during the `UserOperationStruct` object to be sent to the bundler for on-chain execution.

:::details[ClientMiddlewareFn]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/middleware/types.ts:ClientMiddlewareFn]
```

:::

## `EntryPointDef`

An object type that defines the interface for `EntryPoint` functions for packing the user operation to the optimized data structure to enhance performance and reduce gas costs of transactions, and generating the hash of the user operation for the format compatible to the specified `Chain` and `EntryPointVersion`.

:::details[EntryPointDef]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/entrypoint/types.ts:EntryPointDef]
```

:::

## `Multiplier`

An object type with a required `multipler` field, which is a `number` value with max precision of 4 decimal places.

:::details[Multiplier]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/utils/schema.ts:Multiplier
```

:::

## `SmartAccountAuthenticator`

An extension of the [`SmartAccountSigner`](#smartaccountsigner) interface, this interface contains authentication-related functions in addition to the signing methods of the `SmartAccountSigner`. It provides methods to authenticate the signer (`authenticate`) as the "authorized" signer, often as the owner, of the `SmartContractAccount`. It also has methods to retrieve authentication details (`getAuthDetails`) about the signer instance that the user is using to authenticate to one's account.

:::details[SmartAccountAuthenticator]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/signer/types.ts:SmartAccountAuthenticator]
```

:::

## `SmartAccountClient`

`SmartAccountClient` is a custom `viem` `Client`, like the [`BundlerClient`](#bundlerclient), which is an intermediary or connector that enables your client application to interact with the `SmartContractAccount`. `SmartAccountClient` is analogous to the [`WalletClient`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet). The difference is that while `WalletClient` has [`WalletActions`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/introduction) that lets your client application interact with an [Externally-owned account (EOA)](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/accounts) with a [wallet](./terms#wallet), `SmartAccountClient` provides [`SmartAccountClientActions`](#smartaccountclientaction) for client applications to interact with `SmartContractAccounts`.

:::details[SmartAccountClient]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/client/smartAccountClient.ts:SmartAccountClient]
```

:::

## `SmartAccountClientAction`

`SmartAccountClientActions` are `viem` [`Actions`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/introduction) that map one-to-one with smart contract account-related or "signable" actions, such as constructing user operation requests to be sent to the [`Bundler`](./terms#bundler), signing messages or user operation requests, sending user operations to the `Bundler`, upgrading accounts to different implementation address, etc. They are used with a `SmartAccountClient`. `SmartAccountClientActions` require special permissions and provide signing capabilities for `SmartContractAccounts`.

:::details[SmartAccountClientAction]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/client/smartAccountClient.ts:SmartAccountClientActions]
```

:::

## `SmartAccountSigner`

An interface representing a signer capable of signing messages and typed data. It provides methods to retrieve the signer's address (`getAddress`), sign a message (`signMessage`), and sign typed data (`signTypedData`). `SmartAccountSigner` refers to the [`Signer`](./terms#signer) instance responsible for the signing activities using its private key for smart account activities. Often, the `Signer` is referred to as the `Owner` of the account as it has the authority to use the smart account on-chain with its signatures.

:::details[SmartAccountSigner]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/signer/types.ts:SmartAccountSigner]
```

:::

## `SmartContractAccount`

As smart contract accounts are essentially the contract codes that operate on the blockchain, `SmartContractAccount` defines the interface with different functionalities for managing and interacting with the contract account. It includes different functionalities for creating, managing, and using your smart account. In addition to supporting all functionalities achieved with a basic [EOA](./terms#wallet) alone, `SmartContractAccount` can have custom capabilities such as automating processes or executing actions based on predefined conditions. Smart contract wallets allow users to customize how they manage their digital assets, offering a more tailored approach to handling funds securely. `SmartContractAccount` type extends `viem`'s [`Account`](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/custom), and instantiation of an account is done using the [`toSmartContractAccount`](/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/toSmartContractAccount) action.

:::details[SmartContractAccount]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/account/smartContractAccount.ts:SmartContractAccount]
```

:::

## `StateOverride`

A type defining state overrides for [`eth_call`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-eth#eth-call) method. An optional address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be ephemerally overridden prior to executing the call.
State overrides allow you to customize the network state for the purpose of the simulation, so this feature is useful when you need to test or simulate scenarios under conditions that aren’t currently present on the live network.

## `ToSmartContractAccountParams`

This type defines the parameters to the `SmartContractAccount` instantiation action, [`toSmartContractAccount`](/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/toSmartContractAccount). You can configure this parameter to specify the [`Transport`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/intro#transports), [`Chain`](https://viem.sh/docs/glossary/types#chain), [`EntryPointDef`](#entrypointdef), and other base functionalities of the smart account that you are creating.

:::details[ToSmartContractAccountParams]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/account/smartContractAccount.ts:ToSmartContractAccountParams]
```

:::

## `User`

`User` is a type that defines the model for the details of a user's Embedded Account via an Alchemy Signer. It includes the user's `email`, `orgId`, `userId`, `userId`, `address` (the EOA signer address corresponding to the user credentials), and `credentialId`. You can use the [`useUser`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useUser) react hook to look up a user.

:::details[User]

```ts
// [!include ~/../account-kit/signer/src/client/types.ts:User]
```

:::

## `UserOperationCallData`

`UserOperationCallData` is a type that represents the user's "intent" or the desired outcome representing a specific objective a user aims to accomplish. It includes `target` (the destination address), `data` (the [`Transaction calldata`](./terms#transaction-calldata)), and `value` (the amount value of ETH, or the native token to send). It acts as the input to the `sendUserOperation` method on [`SmartAccountClient`](#smartaccountclient).

:::details[UserOperationCallData]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts:UserOperationCallData]
```

:::

## `UserOperationEstimateGasResponse`

An interface that defines the structure for the response received from the RPC method [`eth_estimateUserOperationGas`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-estimateuseroperationgas). This response provides detailed information about the estimated gas usage for a `UserOperation`.

:::details[UserOperationEstimateGasResponse]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts:UserOperationEstimateGasResponse]
```

:::

## `UserOperationOverrides`

Partial structure for overriding default values in a `UserOperationStruct`, such as gas limits and fees. Available fields include `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `callGasLimit`, `preVerificationGas`, `verificationGasLimit`, `paymasterAndData`, or `nonceKey`. You can also specify a `stateOverride` to be passed into `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` during gas estimation. These override values are available from each [`ClientMiddleware`](#clientmiddleware) of the `SmartAccountClient`. Check out [`UserOperationOverrides`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/v4.x.x/aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#L97) page to learn more.

:::details[UserOperationOverrides]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts:UserOperationOverrides]
```

:::

## `UserOperationReceipt`

An interface that defines the structure for the response received from the RPC method [`eth_getUserOperationReceipt`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getuseroperationreceipt). It includes details like sender, nonce, gas cost, and success status of the `UserOperation`.

:::details[UserOperationReceipt]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#UserOperationReceipt
```

:::

## `UserOperationRequest`

Interface for the request format required for a JSON-RPC request to `eth_sendUserOperation`. It includes sender, nonce, gas limits, fees, and more fields.

:::details[UserOperationRequest]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#UserOperationRequest
```

:::

## `UserOperationResponse`

An interface that defines the structure for the response received from the RPC method [`eth_getUserOperationByHash`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getuseroperationbyhash), detailing the result of executing a `UserOperation`. It includes the block number, block hash, transaction hash and more information associated with the UO.

:::details[UserOperationResponse]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#UserOperationResponse
```

:::

## `UserOperationStruct`

Interface for structuring a `UserOperation`, with fields similar to `UserOperationRequest` but used for building requests.

:::details[UserOperationStruct]

```ts
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#UserOperationStruct
```
