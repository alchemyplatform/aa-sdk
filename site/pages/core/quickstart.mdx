# Core Quickstart

If you're not using React, but still want a number of the abstractions that make the React package so easy to use, you can leverage the `@account-kit/core` package directly.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to use this package to send a user operation, while using the reactive utilities exported by this package.

## Install packages

**Prerequisites**

- minimum Typescript version of 5
- pin viem to 2.20.0 (`yarn add viem@2.20.0`)
- pin wagmi to 2.12.7 (`yarn add wagmi@2.12.7`)

**Installation**

To get started, you'll need to install the required packages. We also install the `infra` package because it contains the necessary `Chain` definitions that makes it easier to setup
your a Bundler client.

:::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/core @account-kit/infra
```

```bash [npm]
npm i -s @account-kit/core @account-kit/infra
```

## Get your API keys

## Create a config

Now, you're ready to create a config. The config we create should be a static object that you can import anywhere into your application. It contains all of the state that the functions within
this package use.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

## Authenticate the user

Before you can create a Smart Account instance for your users, you need to authenticate them with the user. Depending on what framework you're using this will look different, but using
email based auth as an example you would:

1. collect the user's email
2. call the `authenticate` method on the signer
3. handle the redirect from the user's email and pass the bundle to the signer to complete login

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { config } from "./config";
import { getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";

const signer = getSigner(config);

if (!signer) {
  // this can happen if your rendering this on the server
  // the signer instance is only available on the client
  throw new Error("Signer not found");
}

// authenticate the user with email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  email: "user@email.com",
});

// once the user has clicked on the email and been redirected back to your site
const bundle = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("bundle");
if (!bundle) {
  throw new Error("No bundle found in URL");
}
await signer.authenticate({ type: "email", bundle });
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

:::

## Send a user operation

Now that you have your config, you can send user operations by leveraging the underlying smart account client.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { watchSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/core";
import { config } from "./config";

let clientState;

// The watch smart account client will handle all of the possible state changes
// that can impact this client:
//  - Signer status
//  - Account instantiation
//  - Chain changes
const clientSubscription = watchSmartAccountClient(
  {
    type: "LightAccount",
  },
  config,
)((clientState_) => {
  clientState = clientState_;
});

if (clientState == null || clientState.isLoadingClient) {
  console.log("Loading...");
}

const client = clientState.client;

await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xtarget",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});
```

```ts twoslash [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

:::

The key thing here is the `watchSmartAccountClient` method which allows you to subscribe to the state of signer and underlying account to give you a stable instance of the Smart Account Client. How you store the `clientState` variable will depend largely on
your framework, but the above example should give you a good starting point.
