# Authenticate users

Most methods on the Smart Account Client and Smart Contract Account require some user context. This context (eg. the `SignerAddress`) is only available once you've authenticated the user. This guide will walk you through how to authenticate users using the `@account-kit/core` package.

## Create your config

Before you can authenticate a user, you'll need to create a static config object. This is outlined in the [Core Quickstart](/core/quickstart).

## Email authentication

Email authentication is a two step process. First, a user inputs their email and initiates the login flow. The user is sent an email which contains a link that redirects them back to your site with an auth credential called a `bundle`. You then complete the authentication with the bundle.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { config } from "./config";
import { getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";

const signer = getSigner(config);

if (!signer) {
  // this can happen if your rendering this on the server
  // the signer instance is only available on the client
  throw new Error("Signer not found");
}

// authenticate the user with email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  email: "user@email.com",
});

// once the user has clicked on the email and been redirected back to your site
const bundle = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("bundle");
if (!bundle) {
  throw new Error("No bundle found in URL");
}

await signer.authenticate({ type: "email", bundle });
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

## Social Login

You can allow users to sign in with an OAuth provider like Google, Facebook, or Auth0. There are two login flows that are possible: redirect and popup. The redirect flow redirects the user to the auth provider's login page, then back to a specified page in your application when done. The popup flow opens the auth provider's login page in a popup window without leaving your application, then updates your application when done. If using popup, you need to set the `enablePopupOauth` field to `true` in the [config](/react/quickstart).

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { config } from "./config";
import { getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";

const signer = getSigner(config);

if (!signer) {
  // this can happen if your rendering this on the server
  // the signer instance is only available on the client
  throw new Error("Signer not found");
}

// authenticate the user with a social login provider
await signer.authenticate({
  // redirect login flow
  type: "oauth",
  authProviderId: "google",
  mode: "redirect",
  redirectUrl: "/", // After logging in, redirect to the index page
});

await signer.authenticate({
  // popup login flow
  type: "oauth",
  authProviderId: "google",
  mode: "popup", // remember to set "enablePopupOauth" to "true" in config.ts to enable
});
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

## Passkey auth with email backup

This approach will allow you to login or signup users using a passkey as the primary auth mechanism and register an email as a backup.

:::danger
It's important that you verify this email to be correct first! Otherwise, if a user loses their passkey, they will not be able to recover their account.

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { config } from "./config.js";
import { getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";

const signer = getSigner(config);

if (!signer) {
  // this can happen if your rendering this on the server
  // the signer instance is only available on the client
  throw new Error("Signer not found");
}

await signer.authenticate({
  type: "passkey",
  email: "name@mail.com",
});
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

## Existing passkey

If your user already has a passkey, then you can authenticate with that directly. This is useful if you want to use email as a signup mechanism, but provide easier login methods for your users via passkeys.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { config } from "./config";
import { getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";

const signer = getSigner(config);

if (!signer) {
  // this can happen if your rendering this on the server
  // the signer instance is only available on the client
  throw new Error("Signer not found");
}

await signer.authenticate({
  type: "passkey",
  createNew: false,
});
```

```ts twoslash [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```
