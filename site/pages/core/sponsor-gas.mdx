# How to sponsor gas for a User Operation

Gas fees are a significant barrier to entry for new user of your app. With Account Kit you can remove this barrier by sponsoring gas fees for transactions via the [Gas Manager](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/gas-manager-services/?a=ak-docs). This guide explains how to sponsor gas by creating a gas policy, linking it to your client, and sending sponsored `UserOperations` (UOs) from a smart account.

After [setting up Account Kit](/core/quickstart) in your project, follow these steps to sponsor gas.

## Create a Gas Manager policy

<GasManagerSnippet />

## Set the Policy ID globally

When creating your Account Kit config, you can optionally pass in a Gas Policy ID. This will enable all UOs sent by the `sendUserOperation` method to be sponsored by the policy you created.

Copy it and then replace the `GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID` in the snippet below.

:::tip
Remember to replace `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your Alchemy API key. If you don't have one yet, you can create an API key on the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=aa-docs).
:::

```ts twoslash
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/core";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY" }),
  chain: sepolia,
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID", // [!code ++]
});
```

Now you can follow the guide for [Sending user operations](/core/send-user-operations) to send sponsored UOs from your smart account!

## Set the gas policy ID per Client

If you want more control over which UOs are sponsored, then you can set the policy ID on a specific instance of the `Smart Account Client` returned by the `watchSmartAccountClient` function.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { watchSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/core";
import { config } from "./config";

// How you actually store this state variable
// depends on the framework you're using
let clientState;

// The watch smart account client will handle all of the possible state changes
// that can impact this client:
//  - Signer status
//  - Account instantiation
//  - Chain changes
const clientSubscription = watchSmartAccountClient(
  {
    type: "LightAccount",
    policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
  },
  config
)((clientState_) => {
  clientState = clientState_;
});

// .. do stuff with the client state
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/core/config.ts]
```

:::

This client is now configured to sponsor gas using your gas policy. You can now send sponsored UOs from this client using the `sendUserOperation` method.
