:::warning
To use Account Kit in your React Native application, ensure you are on React Native version 0.74 or higher.
:::

## Getting Started

We would go through the steps to get your environment setup for using Account Kit within a Bare React Native application.

### Prerequisites

To use Account Kit in your React Native project, ensure your project is setup with React Native version 0.74 or higher.

Please follow the [React Native Upgrade Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/upgrading) if you need to upgrade your project.

### Set up shims

Once we've got our React Native project setup and running, we need to setup a few shims so we can use crypto libraries in React Native.

#### Install shim dependencies

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install --save node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

:::

#### Register shim modules in Metro

Create or edit your `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project so that it includes the following:

```js [metro.config.js]
const { getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig } = require("@react-native/metro-config");

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

const extraNodeModules = {
  ...defaultConfig.resolver.extraNodeModules,
  ...require("node-libs-react-native"),
  crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
  stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
};

const config = {
  resolver: {
    extraNodeModules,
  },
};

module.exports = mergeConfig(defaultConfig, config);
```

#### Register global shims

Import the following packages at the top of your `index.js` file so that libraries that depend on globals like `crypto` have access to them.

```js [index.js]
import "node-libs-react-native/globals.js";
import "react-native-get-random-values";

// rest of index.js
```

### Install Account Kit and build!

That's it! Now you can install the packages you want from Account Kit and start building your React Native Account Abstraction app.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -s @account-kit/smart-contracts @aa-sdk/core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/smart-contracts @aa-sdk/core
```

:::

### Install the React Native Signer Package

:::warning
CAUTION: The React Native Signer package is currently in Alpha and is only supported on Android.
:::

:::info
The Signer package requires you to be on React Native's new architecture. For information on how to enable it in your project, check the [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page).
:::

#### Install the Signer package

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

:::

#### Add supporting dependencies

To ensure the Signer package works correctly, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype
```

:::

### Build and run your project

Now that we've got everything setup, we can build our project!

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
