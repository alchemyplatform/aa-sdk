# Getting Started on an Expo project

We would go through the steps to get your environment setup for using Account Kit within a React Native application on Expo.

<Snippet />

## Create a new Expo project

If you don't have an Expo project setup, you can create one using the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

## Upgrade to the latest version of Expo

The first thing we need to do is make sure we're on the latest version of Expo (SDK 52 or later). The reason for this is that we need React Native version 0.76 or higher because it has `TextEncoder` natively supported.

For more information on upgrading an Expo project, check out the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/).

:::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx expo install expo@latest
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn expo install expo@latest
```

:::

Then you want to upgrade all dependencies to match the new Expo SDK version.

```bash
npx expo install --fix
```

## Set up shims

Once we've got our Expo project setup and running, we need to setup a few shims so we can use crypto libraries in React Native.

### Install shim dependencies

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install --save node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

:::

### Register shim modules in Metro

Create or edit your `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project so that it includes the following:

```js [metro.config.js]
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
// [!code focus:9]
// The following code ensures we have the necessary
// shims for crypto built into our project
config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,
  ...require("node-libs-react-native"),
  crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
  stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
};

module.exports = config;
```

### Register global shims

Import the following packages at the topmost entry point of your app so that libraries that depend on globals like `crypto` have access to them.

If you are using `expo-router`, add the imports in your topmost `_layout.tsx` file in the `app` directory. However if you are using a different navigation library (e.g. `react-navigation`),
add the imports in your topmost `App.tsx` file.

```tsx [App.tsx or app/_layout.tsx]
import "node-libs-react-native/globals.js";
import "react-native-get-random-values";

// rest of App.tsx
```

## Install Account Kit

That's it! Now you can install the packages you want from Account Kit and start building your React Native Account Abstraction app.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -s @account-kit/smart-contracts @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/smart-contracts @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

:::

:::tip
The react-native-signer package is an ESM module. As such, you might have to add the following to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions`:

```json
"module": "NodeNext",
"moduleResolution": "nodenext",
```

:::

### Add supporting dependencies

To ensure the Signer package works correctly, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype react-native-inappbrowser-reborn
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype react-native-inappbrowser-reborn
```

:::

## Set iOS minimum deployment target

Since we require a minimum deployment target of iOS 17, you will need to instruct Expo to set this during pre-build. First, install `expo-build-properties` via:

```bash
npx expo install expo-build-properties
```

Then add the plugin to your `app.json`:

```json
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "17.0"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Run a Prebuild!

Now that we've got everything setup, we can run a prebuild to ensure the native modules are properly built and added to your project.
:::code-group

```bash [android]
npx expo prebuild --platform android
```

```bash [ios]
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
```

:::

## Next steps

Now setup the [signer](/react-native/signer/setup-guide)!
