# How to sponsor gas for a User Operation

Gas fees are a significant barrier to entry for new user of your app. With Account Kit you can remove this barrier by sponsoring gas fees for transactions via the [Gas Manager](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/gas-manager-services/?a=ak-docs). This guide explains how to sponsor gas by creating a gas policy, linking it to your client, and sending sponsored `UserOperations` (UOs) from a smart account.

After [setting up Account Kit](/react-native/signer/setup-guide) in your project, follow these steps to sponsor gas.

## Create a Gas Manager policy

<Snippet />

## Send a sponsored User Operation with the Policy ID

Now you can send a sponsored User Operation with the Policy ID.
