For more information on what a Signer is, refer to the [concepts](/concepts/smart-account-signer) page.

# Setting up your project to use the React Native Signer

Setting up the React Native Signer is similar to setting up the [React Signer](/signer/quickstart) with a few extra steps.

:::info
Only the Email Auth method is supported for the React Native Signer at this time.
:::

1.  Get your **API key** by creating a new app in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
    :::warning
    Make sure **Ethereum** is enabled for your app under the Networks tab
    :::

2.  Create a **new account config** in your [Account Kit Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)

    <br />
    a. Apply the config to your app from step 1
    <img

    	alt="apply your the config to the app from the first step"
    	style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />
    <br />
    b. Enable authentication methods you want to support.

    <br />
    <u>**Email auth**</u>

    To use email auth, toggle on email.

    -   To use email auth in your React Native app, your app needs to be set up to handle deep links that can be served via http or https.
    -   In production scenarios, you would want to set up [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) on android or [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app) on iOS to gracefully handle deep links.
    -   For testing, simply setting up a simple server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) or any other server you control which redirects an incoming request to your app scheme is the easiest way to get started.
        a sample implementation of this can be found the `example` folder of the `React Native Signer` repo.
    -   The http or https url you set up in the previous step would need to be added as the **Redirect URL** in the Account Kit Dashboard.
    -   This is the url that the user will be redirected to when they click the magic link in the email.
    -   Optionally stylize ✨ the email with your brand color and logo!

    <br />

3.  Create the config and copy the **API Key**
