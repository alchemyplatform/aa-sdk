:::warning
To use the signer, your project has to have the new architecture enabled. Refer to the [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/new-architecture/) for more information.
It is recommended to be on the latest Expo SDK version (version 52 or newer) to ensure compatibility.
:::

:::info
This package is not supported on Expo Go. If your app is currently running on Expo Go, you would have to create a development build to use the signer. Check out [Expo Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) for more information.

# Setting up the React Native Signer in an Expo Project

This guide assumes you have an existing Expo project, running on the [new architecure](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here) and have already followed the steps in the [configuration guide](/react-native/signer/configuration-guide) to properly configure your Account Kit project.

To create a new Expo project, please refer to the [Expo Installation Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/).

## Install the React Native Signer Package

To install the React Native Signer package, run the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

:::

## Add Supporting Dependencies

To ensure the signer works properly, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype
```

:::

## Ensure Deep Linking is properly configured

To ensure your app can handle deep links properly, you'll need to setup your app scheme.

Depending on if your app uses `expo-router`, `react-navigation`, or some other navigation library, you'll need to configure deep linking accordingly.

Here are some useful links for some common navigation libraries:

-   [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/into-your-app/)
-   [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/)

## Run an Expo Prebuild

Run an Expo prebuild to ensure all the necessary native modules are properly generated for your project:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform android
```

:::info
Remember the package is only supported on Android at this time.
Running the prebuild command for iOS would result in an error.
:::

## Run your app

Now you should be able to run your app and use the signer as intended.

```bash
npx expo run:android
```
