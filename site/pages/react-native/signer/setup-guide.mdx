For more information on what a Signer is, refer to the [concepts](/concepts/smart-account-signer) page.

# React Native Signer setup guide

:::info
The React Native Signer package is only supported on React Native's new architecture, and requires your project to be on React Native version 0.76 or newer.
:::

Setting up the React Native Signer is similar to setting up the [React Signer](/signer/quickstart) with a few extra steps.

1.  Get your **API key** by creating a new app in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
    :::warning
    Make sure **Ethereum** is enabled for your app under the Networks tab
    :::

2.  Create a **new account config** in your [Account Kit Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)

    <br />
    a. Apply the config to your app from step 1
    <img

      alt="apply your the config to the app from the first step"
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />
    <br />
    b. Enable authentication methods you want to support.

    <br />
    <u>**Email auth**</u>

    To use email auth, toggle on email.

    - To use email auth in your React Native app, your app needs to be set up to handle deep links that can be served via http or https.
    - In production scenarios, you would want to set up [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) on android or [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app) on iOS to gracefully handle deep links.
    - For testing, simply setting up a simple server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) or any other server you control which redirects an incoming request to your app scheme is the easiest way to get started.
      a sample implementation of this can be found the `example` folder of the `React Native Signer` repo.
    - The http or https url you set up in the previous step would need to be added as the **Redirect URL** in the Account Kit Dashboard.
    - This is the url that the user will be redirected to if you use the magic link email flow to log in your users.
    - Optionally stylize ✨ the email with your brand color and logo!

    <br />
    <img
      src="/images/getting-started/email-auth-setup.png"
      alt="configure email auth"
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />
    <br />

    <u>**Social auth**</u>

    If you want to enable social login, toggle which auth providers
    you want to support.

    - Make sure to add your app's deep link as a **whitelisted origin**. This is necessary to handle redirects from the signer after a user has been authenticated.
    - Add the link that your dapp will be running on to the **whitelisted origin** list
    - Optionally enter your own OAuth credentials or use our defaults

    <br />

      src="/images/getting-started/social-auth-setup-mobile.png"
      alt="configure social auth"
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />

3.  Create the config and copy the **API Key**
    <img

      alt="how to copy the api key"
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />

## Ensure Deep Linking is properly configured

If you plan on using email or social auth, you'll need to ensure deep linking is properly configured in your app.

Depending on if your app uses `expo-router`, `react-navigation`, or some other navigation library, you'll need to configure deep linking accordingly.

Here are some useful links for some common navigation libraries:

- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/into-your-app/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/)
