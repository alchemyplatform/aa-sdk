# Authenticating Users via Social Auth

This guide assumes you have already followed the [Setup Guide](/react-native/signer/setup-guide) and have a basic understanding of how to use the Signer in your project.

:::info
For example code on how to use the Signer in your project, please checkout our example apps in our github repository.

-   [Bare React Native Example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-bare-example)
-   [Expo Example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-expo-example)

:::

## Create a Signer Instance

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/react-native/signer.ts]
```

## Authenticate a User

To authenticate a user via **social auth**, use the `signer.authenticate()` method with the `type` set to `OAuth`, the `redirectUrl` set to your app's deep link, the `mode` set to `redirect` and the `authProviderId` set to the social auth provider you want to use.

Here is an example, authenticating a user via Google:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

signer
	.authenticate({
		type: "OAuth",
		redirectUrl: "com.example.app://oauth",
		mode: "redirect",
		authProviderId: "google",
	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.error(error);
	});
```

```ts twoslash [signer.ts] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/react-native/signer.ts]
```
