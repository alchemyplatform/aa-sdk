# Authenticating Users via OTP

This guide assumes you have already followed the [Setup Guide](/react-native/signer/setup-guide) and have a basic understanding of how to use the Signer in your project.

:::info
For example code on how to use the Signer in your project, please checkout our example apps in our github repository.

-   [Bare React Native Example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-bare-example)
-   [Expo Example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-expo-example)

:::

## Create a Signer Instance

```tsx
import { RNAlchemySigner } from "@account-kit/react-native-signer";

const signer = RNAlchemySigner({
	client: { connection: { apiKey: API_KEY } },
});
```

## Authenticate a User

Next, you'll need to authenticate your user before you can use the Signer as an owner on the account

### Send a One-Time Password (OTP) to a User

To send an OTP to a user's email, use the `signer.authenticate()` method with the `emailMode` set to `otp`.

```tsx
signer
	.authenticate({
		email: "user@example.com",
		type: "email",
		emailMode: "otp",
	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.error(error);
	});
```

### Prompt the User to enter the One-Time Password to complete authentication

The user will receive an email with a one-time password (OTP) to enter into your app.

Provide a means for the user to enter the OTP into your app and then call the `signer.authenticate()` method using the `otpCode` parameter to complete the authentication process.

Here's an example of what this might look like:

```tsx [example.tsx] twoslash
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Linking, View, Text, TextInput, Button } from "react-native";
import { User } from "@account-kit/signer";
import { RNAlchemySigner } from "@account-kit/react-native-signer";

const API_KEY = "your-api-key";

const signer = RNAlchemySigner({
	client: { connection: { apiKey: API_KEY } },
});

const App = () => {
	const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
	const [otpCode, setOtpCode] = useState<string>("");

	useEffect(() => {
		// For example purposes only. Make the performAuthRequest() call on mount
		performAuthRequest().catch((error) => {
			console.error(error);
		});
	}, []);

	// Make an authentication request to a user's email
	const performAuthRequest = async () => {
		const user = await signer.authenticate({
			email: "user@example.com",
			type: "email",
			emailMode: "otp",
		});
	};

	// Authenticate a user using a bundle returned from a deep link
	const handleUserAuth = async ({ otpCode }: { otpCode: string }) => {
		const user = await signer.authenticate({ otpCode, type: "otp" }); //<-- Pass the user's OTP code to the authenticate method using `otp` as the type value

		return user;
	};

	return (
		<View>
			<Text>Enter OTP</Text>
			<TextInput
				value={otpCode}
				onChangeText={setOtpCode}
				placeholder="Enter OTP"
			/>
			<Button
				title="Authenticate"
				onPress={() => handleUserAuth({ otpCode })}
			/>

			{/* ... Rest of your app */}
		</View>
	);
};
```
