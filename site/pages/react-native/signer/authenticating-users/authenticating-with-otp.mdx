# Authenticating Users via OTP

This guide assumes you have already followed the [Setup Guide](/react-native/signer/setup-guide) and have a basic understanding of how to use the Signer in your project.

:::info
For example code on how to use the Signer in your project, please checkout our example apps in our github repository.

- [Bare React Native Example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-bare-example)
- [Expo Example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-expo-example)

:::

## Create a Signer Instance

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/react-native/signer.ts]
```

## Authenticate a User

Next, you'll need to authenticate your user before you can use the Signer as an owner on the account

### Send a One-Time Password (OTP) to a User

To send an OTP to a user's email, use the `signer.authenticate()` method with the `emailMode` set to `otp`.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

signer
  .authenticate({
    email: "user@example.com",
    type: "email",
    emailMode: "otp",
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

```ts twoslash [signer.ts] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/react-native/signer.ts]
```

:::

### Prompt the User to enter the One-Time Password to complete authentication

The user will receive an email with a one-time password (OTP) to enter into your app.

Provide a means for the user to enter the OTP into your app and then call the `signer.authenticate()` method using the `otpCode` parameter to complete the authentication process.

Here's an example of what this might look like:

```tsx [example.tsx] twoslash
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Linking, View, Text, TextInput, Button } from "react-native";
import { User } from "@account-kit/signer";
import { RNAlchemySigner } from "@account-kit/react-native-signer";

const API_KEY = "your-api-key";

const signer = RNAlchemySigner({
  client: { connection: { apiKey: API_KEY } },
});

const App = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [otpCode, setOtpCode] = useState<string>("");

  useEffect(() => {
    // For example purposes only. Make the performAuthRequest() call on mount
    performAuthRequest().catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  }, []);

  // Make an authentication request to a user's email
  const performAuthRequest = async () => {
    const user = await signer.authenticate({
      email: "user@example.com",
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "otp",
    });
  };

  // Authenticate a user using a bundle returned from a deep link
  const handleUserAuth = async ({ otpCode }: { otpCode: string }) => {
    const user = await signer.authenticate({ otpCode, type: "otp" }); //<-- Pass the user's OTP code to the authenticate method using `otp` as the type value

    return user;
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Enter OTP</Text>
      <TextInput
        value={otpCode}
        onChangeText={setOtpCode}
        placeholder="Enter OTP"
      />
      <Button
        title="Authenticate"
        onPress={() => handleUserAuth({ otpCode })}
      />

      {/* ... Rest of your app */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
