:::warning
To use the signer, your project has to have the new architecture enabled. Refer to the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page) for more information.
We recommend using the latest version of React Native (version 0.76 or newer).

# Setting up the React Native Signer in a Bare React Native Project

This guide assumes you have an existing React Native project, running on the [new architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page) and have already followed the steps in the [configuration guide](/react-native/signer/configuration-guide) to properly configure your Account Kit project.

To create a new React Native project, please refer to the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment).

## Install the React Native Signer Package

To install the React Native Signer package, run the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

:::

## Add Supporting Dependencies

To ensure the signer works properly, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/signer react-native-mmkv zustand abitype
```

## Ensure Deep Linking is properly configured

To ensure your app can handle deep links properly, you'll need to setup your app scheme.

Depending on if your app uses `react-navigation`, or some other navigation library, you'll need to configure deep linking accordingly.

Here are some useful links for some common navigation libraries:

-   [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/)

## Rebuild and Run your app

Now you should be able to run your app and use the signer as intended.

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

## Getting Started using the Signer

Follow the steps in the [Signer Guide](/react-native/signer/using-the-signer) to authenticate a user and use the signer in your project.
