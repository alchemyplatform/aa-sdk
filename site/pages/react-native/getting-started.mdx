## Getting Started

### Upgrade to the latest Beta version of Expo

We first need to get our environment setup. The first thing we need to do is make sure we're on the latest Beta version of Expo. The reason for this is that we need React Native version 0.74 or higher because it has `TextEncoder` natively supported.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx expo install expo@next --fix
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn expo install expo@next --fix
```

:::

### Set up shims

Once we've got that setup, we need to setup a few shims so we can use crypto libraries in React Native.

#### Install shim dependencies

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install --save node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

:::

#### Register shim modules in Metro

Create or edit your `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project so that it includes the following:

```js [metro.config.js]
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
// [!code focus:9]
// The following code ensures we have the necessary
// shims for crypto built into our project
config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,
  ...require("node-libs-react-native"),
  crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
  stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
};

module.exports = config;
```

#### Register global shims

Import the following packages at the top of your `App.tsx` file so that libraries that depend on globals like `crypto` have access to them.

:::tip
If you're using bare React Native, you would add the above imports to your `index.js` file.
:::

```tsx [App.tsx]
import "node-libs-react-native/globals.js";
import "react-native-get-random-values";

// rest of App.tsx
```

### Install Account Kit and build!

That's it! Now you can install the packages you want from Account Kit and start building your React Native Account Abstraction app.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -s @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-core
```
