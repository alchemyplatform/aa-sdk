# Using within React Native applications

We've built a simple example using expo [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk-rn-expo/tree/main). This guide assumes you're using Expo, but the same principles should apply to a bare React Native app as well.

:::warning
The Alchemy Signer is currently in Alpha and only supported on Android devices. To get started using the Alchemy Signer in your React Native app, refer to the [React Native Signer](/react-native/signer/overview) documentation. For 3rd party signer support in React Native, refer to your signer provider's documentation.
