# Using within React Native applications

We've built a simple example using expo [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk-rn-expo/tree/main). This guide assumes you're using Expo, but the same principles should apply to a bare React Native app as well.

:::warning
The Alchemy Signer is currently in Alpha and only supported on Android devices. To get started using the Alchemy Signer in your React Native app, refer to the [React Native Signer](/react-native/signer/overview) documentation. For 3rd party signer support in React Native, refer to your signer provider's documentation.

## Getting Started

Whether you're using Expo or a bare React Native app, follow our guides to get started with using Account Kit in your project.

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <TileButton
    icon={<ExpoIcon width={24} height={24} />}
    title="Expo"
    description="Get started with using Account Kit in your Expo project"
    href="/react-native/getting-started/getting-started-expo"
  />
  <TileButton
    icon={<ReactNativeIcon width={24} height={24} />}
    title="Bare React Native"
