# Using within React Native applications

We've built a simple example for reference purposes [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-expo-example). This was built using Expo, but the same principles should apply to a bare React Native app as well.

## Getting Started

:::info
If you are starting a fresh project, we highly recommend using Expo. You can easily create a new Expo project by running `npx create-expo-app@latest` from your terminal.
Visit the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) for more information.

Whether you're using Expo or a bare React Native app, follow our guides to get started with using Account Kit in your project.
