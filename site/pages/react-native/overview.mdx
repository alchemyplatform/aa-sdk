# Using within React Native applications

This hasn't been tested extensively, but it is possible to use Account Kit within a React Native application. We've built a simple example using expo [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk-rn-expo/tree/main). This guide assumes you're using Expo, but the same principles should apply to a bare React Native app as well.

:::warning
The Alchemy Signer is not yet supported in React Native applications. For 3rd party signer support in React Native, refer to your signer provider's documentation.
