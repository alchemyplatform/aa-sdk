# useExportAccount

The `useExportAccount` hook exports the user's Embedded Account's recovery details (i.e. account signer/owner) to be viewable on the application.

This will export the signer of the account, not the account itself. To get the signer address of an account, use the [`useUser`](/react/useUser) hook.

:::warning
This requires your user to be logged in. See [`useAuthenticate`](/react/useAuthenticate) for more details.
:::

## Import

```ts
import { useExportAccount } from "@account-kit/react";
```

## Usage

```tsx [useExportAccount.tsx]
// [!include ~/snippets/react/useExportAccount.tsx]
```

## Params

An object containing the following fields.

### params

An optional config object containing `iframeContainerId` as the container ID for the iframe that reveals the account's recovery details, and an [optional] `iframeElementId`as the element ID for the iframe that reveals the account's recovery details. Defaults to `turnkey-export-iframe`.

If `params` is not passed in, the default iframe config will just have an `iframeContainerId` that defaults to `alchemy-signer-iframe-container`.

### exportAccount

`UseMutateFunction`

### isExported

`boolean`
A flag that determines whether the account recovery details were successfully exported and now viewable in the application.

### ExportAccountComponent

`JSX.Element`
A React component you can use to render the exported account recovery details in an iFrame. It takes in props to determine the the styling of the iframee and parent element, and a boolean flag to show the details if they successfully rendered using the mutation function above.

### isExporting

`boolean`
A flag that determines whether the mutation is still running or not.

### error

`Error | null`
A field that relays any errors from the mutation. It is null if there is no error.
