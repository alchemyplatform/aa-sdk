# createConfig

The `createConfig` method is used to create a configuration object that is used to initialize the `AlchemyAccountProvider`. The output of this function contains all of the state that will be used by the various hooks exported by `@alchemy/aa-alchemy/react`.

:::warning
It's not recommended to use the resulting config directly. However, if you are not using `React` it is possible to build your own custom hooks using the state contained in the config object.
