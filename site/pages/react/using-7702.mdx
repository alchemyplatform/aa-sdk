# Using EIP-7702 accounts

We recommend using the default [ModularAccountV2](/smart-contracts/modular-account-v2/overview) as it is the cheapest and most advanced Smart Account, however you can get started with EIP-7702 compatible accounts.

You might consider using EIP-7702 if:

- you need consistent addresses across networks for e.g. multichain app development
- you want to save on initial gas costs since the account contract is not immediately deployed
- you need backward compatibility with EOA infrastructure

## Usage

The following sets up a Smart Account Client using the 7702 version of a Modular Account v2.

```tsx twoslash
import { useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

const { client, address, isLoadingClient } = useSmartAccountClient({
  type: "ModularAccountV2",
  accountParams: {
    mode: "7702",
  },
});
```

## Next steps

Now that you have set up your smart account client with an EIP-7702 account, you can proceed with sending transactions just as you would with any underlying account type created with the `useSmartAccountClient` hook!
