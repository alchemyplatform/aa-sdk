# Authentication methods

Account Kit makes it really easy to authenticate your users using a number of different authentication methods. If you followed the [quickstart](/react/quickstart), then your app is already setup to authenticate users and you can skip this guide!

In this guide, we'll show you two different ways to authenticate users:

1. Using our UI components to handle the entire authentication flow.
2. Using our React hooks to build your own custom UI.

## Set up

If you haven't followed the [quickstart guide](/react/quickstart), make sure to set up the following first:

1.  Create a config in the dashboard
    Go to the [accounts page of the dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts). From here you can create a new config or use an existing one.

    1.  To enable email authentication, in the Redirect URL field add the link that the user will be redirected to when they click the magic link in the email.

              <img

        src="/images/redirect-url.png"
        alt="alchemy create new embedded account config highlighting where to set localhost"
        />

    2.  To enable social authentication, toggle the respective authentication methods you want to enable. Add the link that your dapp will be running on in the Apply whitelisted origin field. You may also include your own Client ID and Client Secret.

    <img
      src="/images/configure-social.png"
      alt="alchemy create new embedded account config highlighting where to configure social login"
    />

2.  Include config API key in your dapp

Copy the API Key from your account config

<img src="/images/copy-api-key.png" alt="how to copy the api key" />

...and paste the API key into your app's `config.ts`

```ts [config.ts]
// ...other stuff in the file
export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your_api_key" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - setup your app and embedded account config in the alchemy dashboard (https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts) - if you don't want to leak api keys, you can proxy to a backend and set the rpcUrl instead here
    chain: sepolia,
    ssr: true, // defers hydration of the account state to the client after the initial mount solving any inconsistencies between server and client state (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr)
    storage: cookieStorage, // persist the account state using cookies (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state)
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
  },
  uiConfig
);
// ...other stuff in the file
```

## Using our UI components

Account Kit allows you to use pre-built, [highly customizable](https://aa-sdk-ui-demo.vercel.app/) UI components to handle authenticating your users. The way you use them is very flexible since you can use the pre-built modal or even embed the Auth card directly in your application.

### Modal auth

Assuming your application has been [set up](/react/quickstart), using UI components is the easiest way to authenticate users. All you have to do is leverage the [`useAuthModal`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAuthModal) hook and provide users a CTA to open the modal.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useAuthModal } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyPage() {
  const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal();

  return <button onClick={openAuthModal}>Authenticate</button>;
}
```

That's it! When the user clicks that button, the modal will open and they can complete authentication. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address

### Embedded auth

The body of the Auth Modal is also exported for you to use directly in your application. This is useful if you don't want a modal flow for login and want a standalone page using the card.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { AuthCard } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row p-4 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
      <AuthCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! The user can now input their credentials and complete login. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address

## Using our React hooks

If you don't want to use our pre-built UI components, you can also use the [`useAuthenticate`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAuthenticate) hook to build your own custom UI.

### Email authentication

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

// This examples uses email authentication
// you can also use passkeys if the user has one created
export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => authenticate({ type: "email", email })}>
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Social Login

You can allow uers to sign in with an OAuth provider like Google, Facebook, or Auth0. There are two login flows that are possible: redirect and popup. The redirect flow redirects the user to the auth provider's login page, then back to a specified page in your application when done. The popup flow opens the auth provider's login page in a popup window without leaving your application, then updates your application when done. If using popup, you need to set the `enablePopupOauth` field to `true` in the [config](/react/quickstart).

For the authentication methods that Alchemy supports, authenticate by doing the following

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

// This examples uses social login, specifically Google Sign-In
export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          authenticate({
            // redirect login flow
            type: "oauth",
            authProviderId: "google",
            mode: "redirect",
            redirectUrl: "/", // After logging in, redirect to the index page
          })
        }
      >
        Login (Redirect)
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          authenticate({
            // popup login flow
            type: "oauth",
            authProviderId: "google",
            mode: "popup", // remember to set "enablePopupOauth" to "true" in config.ts to enable
          })
        }
      >
        Login (Popup)
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

To use your own auth provider, follow the instructions on how to do so with [Auth0](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/signer/authentication/auth0)

### Passkey auth with email backup

This approach will allow you to login or signup users using a passkey as the primary auth mechanism and register an email as a backup.

:::danger
It's important that you verify this email to be correct first! Otherwise, if a user loses their passkey, they will not be able to recover their account.
:::

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => authenticate({ type: "passkey", email })}>
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Existing Passkey

If your user already has a passkey, then you can authenticate with that directly. This is useful if you want to use email as a signup mechanism, but provide easier login methods for your users via passkeys.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => authenticate({ type: "passkey", createNew: false })}
      >
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
