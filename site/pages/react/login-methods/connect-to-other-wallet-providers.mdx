## Seamlessly Connect with Existing EOA Wallets

Easily log in using popular wallet providers like **MetaMask**, **Rabby**, **Phantom**, and more.

Our SDK supports external wallet connection out of the box, so you can seamlessly support both web2 users with social login and web3 users who want to bring their own EOAs.
We support enabling users to bring their existing EOA in 2 ways:

1. **Automatically detect and display all wallet extensions available in the user's browser.** (_Note: if the user has no wallet extensions installed, nothing will be displayed_)
2. **WalletConnect for all other EOAs**

With Account Kit, users can still connect to their existing wallets without sacrificing compatibility or convenience.

Our hooks will handle checking if the connected wallet is a smart wallet or an existing EOA.
Transactions can be signed and sent in the same way, but external EOA wallets don't have access to Account Abstraction benefits such as gas abstraction, batching, etc.
These EOAs will simply function as EOAs.

In order to access these external wallet providers, just make sure to include configure `type: "external_wallets"` in your config:

```ts twoslash [src/config.ts]
// @noErrors
import { createConfig, cookieStorage } from "@account-kit/react";
import { alchemy, sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    // alchemy config
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your_api_key" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - setup your app and embedded account config in the alchemy dashboard (https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)
    chain: sepolia, // TODO: specify your preferred chain here and update imports from @account-kit/infra
    ssr: true, // Defers hydration of the account state to the client after the initial mount solving any inconsistencies between server and client state (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr)
    storage: cookieStorage, // persist the account state using cookies (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state)
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
    // optional config to override default session manager config
    sessionConfig: {
      expirationTimeMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 60 minutes (default is 15 min)
    },
  },
  {
    // authentication ui config - your customizations here
    auth: {
      sections: [
        [{ type: "email" }],
        [
          { type: "passkey" },
          { type: "social", authProviderId: "google", mode: "popup" },
          { type: "social", authProviderId: "facebook", mode: "popup" },
        ],
        [
          {
            type: "external_wallets",
            walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
          },
        ],
      ],
      addPasskeyOnSignup: true,
      showSignInText: true,
    },
  }
);
```

In order to access other providers via `WalletConnect`, **also** add `walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" }` to your config:

```ts twoslash [src/config.ts]
// @noErrors
[
  {
    type: "external_wallets",
    walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
  },
];
```
