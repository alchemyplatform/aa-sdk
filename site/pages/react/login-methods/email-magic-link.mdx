# Email Magic Link Authentication

Email magic link authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a magic link
2. The user clicks the link in their email, which redirects them back to your application to complete authentication

:::tip
Email OTP has been shown to have up to a 3x higher conversion rate and a 10-second faster flow compared to magic links. Consider using [Email OTP](/react/login-methods/email-otp) for better user experience.

You can implement Email Magic Link authentication in two ways:

- [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
- [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

## Pre-built UI Components

Account Kit provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Email Magic Link authentication flow with minimal code.

### Step 1: Add Authentication Components to Your Page

Before configuring your authentication, first add one of the pre-built components to your application:

<ModalAuthExample />

Or:

<EmbeddedAuthExample />

### Step 2: Configure Email Magic Link in UI Components

After adding the components, configure the Email Magic Link authentication in your application config:

```tsx twoslash
import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
  auth: {
    sections: [
      [
        {
          type: "email",
          emailMode: "magicLink",

          // Optional customizations:
          buttonLabel: "Continue with Email",
          placeholder: "Enter your email address",
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
};

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
    chain: sepolia,
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

Email Magic Link configuration accepts the following options:

```ts
type EmailAuthType = {
  type: "email";
  emailMode: "magicLink";
  // hides the continue button
  hideButton?: boolean;
  // changes the button label
  buttonLabel?: string;
  // changes the placeholder text in the input
  placeholder?: string;
};
```

You can find the full type definition in the [Account Kit source code](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/components/auth/types.ts).

For more details on UI component customization, see the [UI Components](/react/ui-components) documentation.

## Custom UI

If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Email Magic Link authentication using Account Kit hooks.

### Step 1: Send the Magic Link

First, prompt your user for their email address and send a magic link:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits their email
const handleSendMagicLink = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "magicLink",
      email,
    });
    // Success - inform user to check their email
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Handle the Redirect

When the user clicks the magic link in their email, they'll be redirected back to your application. You need to extract the authentication bundle from the URL and complete the authentication:

```tsx twoslash
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// Handle the redirect when the component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  const handleRedirect = async () => {
    const url = new URL(window.location.href);
    const bundle = url.searchParams.get("bundle");

    if (bundle) {
      try {
        await authenticate({
          type: "email",
          bundle,
        });
        // Authentication successful!
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
      }
    }
  };

  handleRedirect();
}, [authenticate]);
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```

## Next Steps

### Add Authenticator App (TOTP) Verification (Optional)

Consider enabling [Multi-Factor Authentication](/react/mfa/setup-mfa) to require users to enter a 6-digit TOTP code from their authenticator app after clicking the magic link. This extra layer of security protects user accounts if their email is compromised.
