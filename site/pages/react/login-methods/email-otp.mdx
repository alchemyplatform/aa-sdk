# Email OTP Authentication

Email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a verification code
2. The user enters the 6-digit code they receive in their inbox to complete authentication

You can implement Email OTP authentication in two ways:

- [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
- [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

## Pre-built UI Components

Account Kit provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Email OTP authentication flow with minimal code. Follow the instructions in the [Pre-built UI](/react/ui-components) documentation to set up the authentication modal or embedded auth card in your application.

### Configuring Email OTP in UI Components

To customize the Email OTP authentication experience in your pre-built components, configure the UI as follows:

```tsx
import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
  auth: {
    sections: [
      [
        {
          type: "email",
          // Optional customizations:
          buttonLabel: "Continue with Email",
          placeholder: "Enter your email address",
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
};

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
    chain: sepolia,
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

For more details on UI component customization, see the [UI Components](/react/ui-components) documentation.

## Custom UI

If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Email OTP authentication using Account Kit hooks.

### Step 1: Send the OTP

First, prompt your user for their email address and send an OTP:

```tsx
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits their email
const handleSendCode = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "otp",
      email,
    });
    // Success - now show the OTP input form
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Verify the OTP

Once the user receives the code, they'll enter it in your application:

```tsx
// When the user submits the OTP code
const handleVerifyCode = async (otpCode: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "otp",
      otpCode,
    });
    // Authentication successful!
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle invalid code error
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
