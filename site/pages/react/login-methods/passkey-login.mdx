# Passkey Login Authentication

If a user has added a passkey to their account, or they initially signed up with a passkey, you can easily authenticate them using that passkey. This provides a secure, passwordless authentication experience.

You can implement Passkey Login authentication in two ways:

- [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
- [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

## Pre-built UI Components

Account Kit provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Passkey Login authentication flow with minimal code.

### Step 1: Add Authentication Components to Your Page

Before configuring your authentication, first add one of the pre-built components to your application:

<ModalAuthExample />

Or:

<EmbeddedAuthExample />

### Step 2: Configure Passkey Login in UI Components

After adding the components, configure the Passkey Login authentication in your application config:

To customize the Passkey Login authentication experience in your pre-built components, configure the UI as follows:

```tsx twoslash
import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
  auth: {
    sections: [
      [
        // Include passkey login in a section
        { type: "passkey" },

        // You can combine with other authentication methods
        { type: "email" },
      ],
    ],
  },
};

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
    chain: sepolia,
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

Passkey login configuration accepts the following options:

```ts twoslash
type PasskeyAuthType = {
  type: "passkey";
};
```

You can find the full type definition in the [Account Kit source code](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/components/auth/types.ts).

For more details on UI component customization, see the [UI Components](/react/ui-components) documentation.

## Custom UI

If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Passkey Login authentication using Account Kit hooks.

### Option 1: Passkey Login with Email

If the user's passkey is associated with an email, you can use the email to help identify the correct passkey:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user wants to log in with their passkey and email
const handlePasskeyLogin = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      email,
    });
    // Success - user authenticated with passkey
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Passkey Login without Email

If you want to authenticate a user with just their passkey (without requiring an email), you can use this approach:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user wants to log in with just their passkey
const handlePasskeyOnlyLogin = async () => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      createNew: false, // Important: set to false to prevent creating a new passkey
    });
    // Success - user authenticated with passkey
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
