# useSignMessage

The `useSignMessage` hook enables signing a message on behalf of the user's Embedded Account. If the account is not yet deployed onchain, this will use [ERC-6492](/resources/terms#erc-6492) to sign the message.

:::warning
This requires your user to be logged in. See [`useAuthenticate`](/react/useAuthenticate) for more details.
