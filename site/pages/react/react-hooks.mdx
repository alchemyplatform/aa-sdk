# Custom UI for Authentication

While Account Kit provides pre-built UI components for authentication, you may want to create your own custom UI to match your application's design system. This section covers how to implement custom authentication flows using Account Kit hooks.

:::tip
Tailwind CSS is a required dependency for using Alchemy Account Kit UI components. However, Alchemy Account Kit hooks function independently and do not require Tailwind.

## Available Authentication Methods

Account Kit supports several authentication methods that you can implement with custom UI. Each method has its own dedicated page with detailed implementation instructions, code examples, and specific parameters for the authentication hooks:

- [Email OTP](/react/login-methods/email-otp) - One-time password sent via email
- [Email Magic Link](/react/login-methods/email-magic-link) - Authentication links sent via email
- [Social Login](/react/login-methods/social-login) - Authentication with providers like Google and Facebook
- [Custom Social Providers](/react/login-methods/social-providers) - Add custom OAuth providers via Auth0
- [Passkey Signup](/react/login-methods/passkey-signup) - Create accounts with passkeys
- [Passkey Login](/react/login-methods/passkey-login) - Authenticate with existing passkeys

**Visit each method's dedicated page** for specific implementation details, including the exact parameters to use with the `useAuthenticate` hook for that authentication method.

## Core Hooks for Custom UI

The following section provides an overview of the main hooks you'll use when implementing custom authentication UI. These hooks are the foundation for all authentication methods, but their specific usage and parameters vary depending on the authentication method you choose.

### useAuthenticate

The `useAuthenticate` hook is the foundation for all authentication methods. It provides the `authenticate` function that handles the authentication process.

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

function MyAuthComponent() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();

  // Use authenticate with different parameters based on auth method
  // The specific parameters depend on the authentication method
  // See the individual authentication method pages for details
}
```

### useAccount

The `useAccount` hook provides information about the authenticated user's account.

```tsx twoslash
import { useAccount } from "@account-kit/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { account, address, isLoadingAccount } = useAccount({});
}
```

## Getting Started

To implement custom authentication UI:

1. **Choose an authentication method** from the list above and visit its dedicated page
2. Follow the method-specific implementation guidelines on that page
3. Use the core hooks described above following the method-specific parameters
4. Implement the UI components for your chosen authentication flow
5. Handle success and error states appropriately

Each authentication method page provides detailed code examples tailored to that specific method, showing exactly how to configure the hooks and implement the entire authentication flow.
