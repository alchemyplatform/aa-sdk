# Custom UI for Email Magic Link Authentication

:::tip
Account Kit provides [pre-built UI components](/react/ui-components) that handle email magic link authentication with minimal code. Consider using these components before building custom UI!
:::

This guide shows you how to implement a custom UI for email magic link authentication in your React application using Account Kit hooks.

## Overview

Email magic link authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a magic link
2. The user clicks the link in their email, which redirects them back to your application to complete authentication

:::tip
Email OTP has been shown to have up to a 3x higher conversion rate and a 10-second faster flow compared to magic links. Consider using [Email OTP](/react/custom-ui/email-otp) for better user experience.

## Implementation

To authenticate users with email magic links, you'll use the `useAuthenticate` hook from Account Kit.

### Step 1: Send the Magic Link

First, prompt your user for their email address and send a magic link:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits their email
const handleSendMagicLink = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "magicLink",
      email,
    });
    // Success - inform user to check their email
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Handle the Redirect

When the user clicks the magic link in their email, they'll be redirected back to your application. You need to extract the authentication bundle from the URL and complete the authentication:

```tsx twoslash
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// Handle the redirect when the component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  const handleRedirect = async () => {
    const url = new URL(window.location.href);
    const bundle = url.searchParams.get("bundle");

    if (bundle) {
      try {
        await authenticate({
          type: "email",
          bundle,
        });
        // Authentication successful!
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
      }
    }
  };

  handleRedirect();
}, [authenticate]);
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
