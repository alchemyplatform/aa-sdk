# Custom UI for Authentication

While Account Kit provides pre-built UI components for authentication, you may want to create your own custom UI to match your application's design system. This section covers how to implement custom authentication flows using Account Kit hooks.

## Available Authentication Methods

Account Kit supports several authentication methods that you can implement with custom UI:

- [Email OTP](/react/custom-ui/email-otp) - One-time password sent via email
- [Email Magic Link](/react/custom-ui/email-magic-link) - Authentication links sent via email
- [Social Login](/react/custom-ui/social-login) - Authentication with providers like Google and Facebook
- [Custom Social Providers](/react/custom-ui/social-providers) - Add custom OAuth providers via Auth0
- [Passkey Signup](/react/custom-ui/passkey-signup) - Create accounts with passkeys
- [Passkey Login](/react/custom-ui/passkey-login) - Authenticate with existing passkeys

## Core Hooks for Custom UI

When building custom authentication UI, you'll primarily work with these hooks:

### useAuthenticate

The `useAuthenticate` hook is the foundation for all authentication methods. It provides the `authenticate` function that handles the authentication process.

```tsx
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

function MyAuthComponent() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();

  // Use authenticate with different parameters based on auth method
  // isPending indicates if authentication is in progress
}
```

### useAccount

The `useAccount` hook provides information about the authenticated user's account.

```tsx
import { useAccount } from "@account-kit/react";

function MyComponent() {
  import { useAccount } from "@account-kit/react";

  const { account, address, isLoadingAccount } = useAccount({
    type: "LightAccount",
  });
}
```

## Getting Started

To implement custom authentication UI:

1. Choose the authentication method(s) you want to support
2. Implement the UI components using the appropriate hooks
3. Handle success and error states appropriately
4. Track authentication status to update your UI

Check the individual authentication method pages for specific implementation details.
