# Custom UI for Passkey Signup

:::tip
Account Kit provides [pre-built UI components](/react/ui-components) that handle passkey signup with minimal code. Consider using these components before building custom UI!
:::

This guide shows you how to implement a custom UI for passkey signup in your React application using Account Kit hooks.

## Overview

Passkeys provide a secure, passwordless authentication method that can be used to create wallets for your users without going through email verification flows. You can implement passkey signup with or without an associated email address.

:::warning
If you create a passkey without an email associated with the user, you risk your users losing access to their wallets if they lose their device.
:::

## Implementation

To implement passkey signup, you'll use the `useAuthenticate` hook from Account Kit.

### Option 1: Passkey Signup with Email (Recommended)

This approach associates an email with the passkey, allowing users to recover their account if they lose access to their device.

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits their email and wants to create a passkey
const handlePasskeySignup = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    // Important: Validate the email before proceeding
    if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
      throw new Error("Please enter a valid email address");
    }

    await authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      email,
    });
    // Success - passkey created and user authenticated
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};

// Simple email validation function
const isValidEmail = (email: string) => {
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
};
```

:::danger
It's important that you validate the email before creating an account for the user. This is to prevent users from losing access to their wallets if they lose their device.
:::

### Option 2: Passkey Signup without Email

This approach creates a passkey without an associated email. Use this only if you have another recovery mechanism in place.

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user wants to create a passkey without email
const handlePasskeyOnlySignup = async (username: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      createNew: true,
      username, // A unique identifier for the passkey
    });
    // Success - passkey created and user authenticated
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
