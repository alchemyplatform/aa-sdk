# Custom UI for Passkey Login

:::tip
Account Kit provides [pre-built UI components](/react/ui-components) that handle passkey login with minimal code. Consider using these components before building custom UI!
:::

This guide shows you how to implement a custom UI for passkey login in your React application using Account Kit hooks.

## Overview

If a user has added a passkey to their account, or they initially signed up with a passkey, you can easily authenticate them using that passkey. This provides a secure, passwordless authentication experience.

## Implementation

To implement passkey login, you'll use the `useAuthenticate` hook from Account Kit.

### Option 1: Passkey Login with Email

If the user's passkey is associated with an email, you can use the email to help identify the correct passkey:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user wants to log in with their passkey and email
const handlePasskeyLogin = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      email,
    });
    // Success - user authenticated with passkey
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Passkey Login without Email

If you want to authenticate a user with just their passkey (without requiring an email), you can use this approach:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user wants to log in with just their passkey
const handlePasskeyOnlyLogin = async () => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      createNew: false, // Important: set to false to prevent creating a new passkey
    });
    // Success - user authenticated with passkey
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
