# Custom UI for Email OTP Authentication

This guide shows you how to implement a custom UI for email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication in your React application using Account Kit hooks.

## Overview

Email OTP authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a verification code
2. The user enters the 6-digit code they receive in their inbox to complete authentication

## Implementation

To authenticate users with email OTP, you'll use the `useAuthenticate` hook from Account Kit.

### Step 1: Send the OTP

First, prompt your user for their email address and send an OTP:

```tsx
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits their email
const handleSendCode = async (email: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "otp",
      email,
    });
    // Success - now show the OTP input form
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Verify the OTP

Once the user receives the code, they'll enter it in your application:

```tsx
// When the user submits the OTP code
const handleVerifyCode = async (otpCode: string) => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "otp",
      otpCode,
    });
    // Authentication successful!
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle invalid code error
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
