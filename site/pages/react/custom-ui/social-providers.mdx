# Custom Social Providers with Auth0

:::tip
Account Kit provides [pre-built UI components](/react/ui-components) that can be configured to use custom social providers. Consider using these components before building custom UI!
:::

This guide shows you how to implement custom social login providers using Auth0 in your React application with Account Kit hooks.

## Overview

In addition to the standard social login providers (Google, Facebook, Apple), Account Kit allows you to integrate custom OAuth providers through Auth0. This gives you flexibility to add authentication methods like GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up Auth0

Before implementing in your React app, you need to configure Auth0:

1. Create or log in to an account on [auth0.com](https://auth0.com)
2. In the Auth0 dashboard, go to "Authentication → Social" in the sidebar
3. Click "Create Social Connection" and choose your desired provider (e.g., GitHub)
4. Configure the provider with appropriate credentials and permissions
5. Note the "Name" field (e.g., "github") - you'll need this later
6. Enable the connection for your Auth0 application

### Step 2: Add Auth0 Credentials to Account Kit

Add your Auth0 credentials to the Account Kit dashboard:

1. From your Auth0 dashboard, go to "Applications → Applications"
2. Select your application and note the "Domain", "Client ID", and "Client Secret"
3. Add these to your Account Kit dashboard in the embedded accounts auth config

### Step 3: Implement Authentication in Your React App

Use the `useAuthenticate` hook to implement Auth0 authentication:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// Option 1: Generic Auth0 login (shows Auth0 provider selection screen)
const handleAuth0Login = async () => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "oauth",
      authProviderId: "auth0",
      mode: "popup", // or "redirect"
    });
    // Authentication successful!
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};

// Option 2: Direct provider login (bypasses Auth0 selection screen)
const handleGitHubLogin = async () => {
  try {
    await authenticate({
      type: "oauth",
      authProviderId: "auth0",
      auth0Connection: "github", // Use the connection name from Auth0
      mode: "popup", // or "redirect"
    });
    // Authentication successful!
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Track Authentication Status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```
