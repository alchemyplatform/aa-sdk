# Authenticate users

Account Kit makes it really easy to authenticate your users using a number of different authentication methods. If you followed the [quickstart](/react/quickstart), then your app is already setup to authenticate users and you can skip this guide!

In this guide, we'll show you two different ways to authenticate users:

1. Using our UI components to handle the entire authentication flow.
2. Using our React hooks to build your own custom UI.

## Using our UI components

Account Kit allows you to use pre-built, [highly customizable](https://aa-sdk-ui-demo.vercel.app/) UI components to handle authenticating your users. The way you use them is very flexible since you can use the pre-built modal or even embed the Auth card directly in your application.

### Modal auth

Assuming your application has been [set up](/react/quickstart), using UI components is the easiest way to authenticate users. All you have to do is leverage the [`useAuthModal`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAuthModal) hook and provide users a CTA to open the modal.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useAuthModal } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyPage() {
  const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal();

  return <button onClick={openAuthModal}>Authenticate</button>;
}
```

That's it! When the user clicks that button, the modal will open and they can complete authentication. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address

### Embedded auth

The body of the Auth Modal is also exported for you to use directly in your application. This is useful if you don't want a modal flow for login and want a standalone page using the card.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { AuthCard } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row p-4 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
      <AuthCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! The user can now input their credentials and complete login. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address

## Using our React hooks

If you don't want to use our pre-built UI components, you can also use the [`useAuthenticate`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAuthenticate) hook to build your own custom UI.

### Email authentication

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

// This examples uses email authentication
// you can also use passkeys if the user has one created
export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => authenticate({ type: "email", email })}>
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Social Login

You can allow uers to sign in with an OAuth provider like Google, Facebook, or Auth0. There are two login flows that are possible: redirect and popup. The redirect flow redirects the user to the auth provider's login page, then back to a specified page in your application when done. The popup flow opens the auth provider's login page in a popup window without leaving your application, then updates your application when done. If using popup, you need to set the `enablePopupOauth` field to `true` in the [config](/react/quickstart).

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

// This examples uses social login, specifically Google Sign-In
export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          authenticate({
            // redirect login flow
            type: "oauth",
            authProviderId: "google",
            mode: "redirect",
            redirectUrl: "/", // After logging in, redirect to the index page
          })
        }
      >
        Login (Redirect)
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          authenticate({
            // popup login flow
            type: "oauth",
            authProviderId: "google",
            mode: "popup", // remember to set "enablePopupOauth" to "true" in config.ts to enable
          })
        }
      >
        Login (Popup)
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Passkey auth with email backup

This approach will allow you to login or signup users using a passkey as the primary auth mechanism and register an email as a backup.

:::danger
It's important that you verify this email to be correct first! Otherwise, if a user loses their passkey, they will not be able to recover their account.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate, isPending } = useAuthenticate();
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => authenticate({ type: "passkey", email })}>
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Existing Passkey

If your user already has a passkey, then you can authenticate with that directly. This is useful if you want to use email as a signup mechanism, but provide easier login methods for your users via passkeys.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  type UseAuthenticateResult,
  useAuthenticate,
} from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => authenticate({ type: "passkey", createNew: false })}
      >
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
