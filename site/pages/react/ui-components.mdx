# Using our UI components

Account Kit allows you to use pre-built, [highly customizable](https://aa-sdk-ui-demo.vercel.app/) UI components to handle authenticating your users. The way you use them is very flexible since you can use the pre-built modal or even embed the Auth card directly in your application.

### Modal auth

Assuming your application has been [set up](/react/quickstart), using UI components is the easiest way to authenticate users. All you have to do is leverage the [`useAuthModal`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAuthModal) hook and provide users a CTA to open the modal.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useAuthModal } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyPage() {
  const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal();

  return <button onClick={openAuthModal}>Authenticate</button>;
}
```

That's it! When the user clicks that button, the modal will open and they can complete authentication. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address

### Embedded auth

The body of the Auth Modal is also exported for you to use directly in your application. This is useful if you don't want a modal flow for login and want a standalone page using the card.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { AuthCard } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row p-4 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
      <AuthCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! The user can now input their credentials and complete login. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address
