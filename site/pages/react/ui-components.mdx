# Authentication with our UI components

Account Kit allows you to use pre-built, [highly customizable](https://demo.alchemy.com/) UI components to handle authenticating your users. These components provide flexibility to:

- use the pre-built [modal](#modal-auth) or [embed](#embedded-auth) the auth card directly in your app
- customize [authentication method ui](#customize-authentication-ui)
- customize [theme](/react/customization/theme)

:::tip
Tailwind CSS is a required dependency for using Alchemy Account Kit UI components. However, Alchemy Account Kit hooks function independently and do not require Tailwind.
:::

## Modal auth

Assuming your application has been [set up](/react/quickstart), using UI components is the easiest way to authenticate users. All you have to do is leverage the [`useAuthModal`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAuthModal) hook and provide users a CTA to open the modal.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useAuthModal } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyPage() {
  const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal();

  return <button onClick={openAuthModal}>Authenticate</button>;
}
```

That's it! When the user clicks that button, the modal will open and they can complete authentication. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address.

**Want to display a loading state during authentication?** <br/>
For authentication with redirects in a modal, you may want to add a loading state when users are waiting for authentication to complete.
To do this, manage the loading state directly using our hooks, as shown below. In embedded authentication and non-redirect flows, such as passkey authentication, we handle the loading state for you.

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthModal, useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal();
const { isAuthenticating } = useSignerStatus();

useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticating) {
    openAuthModal();
  }
}, [openAuthModal, isAuthenticating]);
```

## Embedded auth

The body of the Auth Modal is also exported for you to use directly in your application. This is useful if you don't want a modal flow for login and want a standalone page using the card.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { AuthCard } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyLoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row p-4 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
      <AuthCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! The user can now input their credentials and complete login. Once they are authenticated, you can use the [`useAccount`](/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount) hook to get the logged in user's SCA address

## Customize authentication UI

When rendering the authentication component to your users, it's possible to customize the various sections a user will see as well as the content of the modal.

:::tip
The easiest way to configure your UI components, is using the [Demo App](https://demo.alchemy.com/).
:::

**How does the UI config work?**

- `auth` property accepts a `sections` object
- `sections` object is an array of arrays representing the various sections in descending order, each section (element in the outer array) separated by a divider in the UI
- each item within a section is an `AuthTypes` objects containing configuration parameters for that authentication method.

  <br />

**The following [`AuthTypes`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/components/auth/types.ts)
can be passed into sections:**

### Email

This adds an email login to a section. The shape of this auth type is:

```ts
type EmailAuthType = {
  type: "email";
  // hides the continue button
  hideButton?: boolean;
  // changes the button label
  buttonLabel?: string;
  // changes the placeholder text in the input
  placeholder?: string;
};
```

### Passkey

This adds a passkey login method to a section. Passkey login allows users to login with a passkey they've created else where in your app after logging in, or right after sign-up if you've enabled that setting.
The shape of this auth type is:

```ts
type PasskeyAuthType = {
  type: "passkey";
};
```

### External wallets

This adds an external wallet login method to a section. This allows users to connect to your app with existing EOAs via browser extension or WalletConnect.
The shape of this auth type is:

```ts
type ExternalWalletsAuthType = {
  type: "external_wallets";
  // if this is undefined, wallet connect will not be displayed
  walletConnect?: WalletConnectParameters;
};
```

### Social

This adds social authentication methods to a section. Social login authentication allows you to login and signup users using an OAuth provider, such as Google Sign-In or Facebook Login. You can also configure custom providers through Auth0. The shape of this auth type is:

```ts
type SocialAuthType = {
  type: "social";
  // Specifies the requested OAuth scope
  scope?: string;
  // Specifies additional claims to be included in the authentication token
  claims?: string;
} & (
  | {
      // For using the Auth0 authentication provider
      authProviderId: "auth0";
      // Indicates whether a custom provider is used (default is false)
      isCustomProvider?: false;
      // Auth0-specific connection string
      auth0Connection?: string;
      // URL for the provider's logo
      logoUrl: string;
    }
  | {
      // For using a known authentication provider other than Auth0: "google", "facebook", "apple"
      authProviderId: KnownAuthProvider;
      // Indicates whether a custom provider is used (default false)
      isCustomProvider?: false;
      // Auth0 connection should not be specified when using other providers
      auth0Connection?: never;
      // Logo URL is optional for other providers
      logoUrl?: never;
    }
) &
  OauthRedirectConfig;
```

### Example

Here's an example ui configuration which adds 3 sections to the auth modal. The first section contains an email auth, the second section is for passkey login and 2 social auth logins (google and facebook), and the third section is external wallets.

```ts twoslash
import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
  illustrationStyle: "outline",
  auth: {
    sections: [
      [{ type: "email" }],
      [
        { type: "passkey" },
        { type: "social", authProviderId: "google", mode: "popup" },
        { type: "social", authProviderId: "facebook", mode: "popup" },
      ],
      [
        {
          type: "external_wallets",
          walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
        },
      ],
    ],
    addPasskeyOnSignup: false,
  },
};

export const confg = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
    chain: sepolia,
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

This example would output a modal similar to this image:

<img
  src="/images/example-custom-ui-config.png"
  alt="Example custom UI config"
  style={{ width: "20%" }}
/>
