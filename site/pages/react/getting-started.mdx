# Getting started with authentication

Account Kit makes it really easy to authenticate your users using a number of different authentication methods. If you followed the [quickstart](/react/quickstart), then your app is already setup to authenticate users and you can skip this guide!

## Authentication Methods

Account Kit supports several authentication methods:

- [**Email OTP**](/react/login-methods/email-otp) - One-time password sent via email
- [**Email Magic Link**](/react/login-methods/email-magic-link) - Authentication links sent via email
- [**Social Login**](/react/login-methods/social-login) - Authentication with providers like Google and Facebook
- [**Custom Social Providers**](/react/login-methods/social-providers) - Add custom OAuth providers via Auth0
- [**Passkey Signup**](/react/login-methods/passkey-signup) - Create accounts with passkeys
- [**Passkey Login**](/react/login-methods/passkey-login) - Authenticate with existing passkeys

## Implementation Options

For each authentication method, you have two implementation options:

1. [**Pre-built UI Components**](/react/ui-components) - Ready-to-use components that handle the entire authentication flow with minimal code and customizable styling.

2. [**Custom UI with React Hooks**](/react/react-hooks) - Build your own UI components using our React hooks for complete control over the user experience.

# Setup

If you haven't followed the [quickstart guide](/react/quickstart), make sure to set up the following first:

<Snippet />

...and paste the API key into your app's `config.ts`

```ts [config.ts]
// ...other stuff in the file
export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts
    chain: sepolia,
    ssr: true, // more about ssr: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr
    storage: cookieStorage, // more about persisting state with cookies: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
  },
  uiConfig
);
// ...other stuff in the file
```

# What's next?

Now you can choose which authentication methods you want to implement and how you want to implement them:

1. [Using our Pre-built UI components](/react/ui-components) to handle the entire authentication flow with minimal code.
2. [Using our React hooks](/react/react-hooks) to build your own custom UI for complete control.

Each authentication method has dedicated documentation for both implementation approaches.
