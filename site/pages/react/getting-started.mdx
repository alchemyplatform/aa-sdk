# Getting started with authentication

Account Kit makes it really easy to authenticate your users using a number of different authentication methods. If you followed the [quickstart](/react/quickstart), then your app is already setup to authenticate users and you can skip this guide!

We'll show you two different ways to authenticate users:

1. [Using our UI components](/react/ui-components) to handle the entire authentication flow.
2. [Using our React hooks](/react/react-hooks) to build your own custom UI.

# Setup

If you haven't followed the [quickstart guide](/react/quickstart), make sure to set up the following first:

<Snippet />

...and paste the API key into your app's `config.ts`

```ts [config.ts]
// ...other stuff in the file
export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts
    chain: sepolia,
    ssr: true, // more about ssr: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr
    storage: cookieStorage, // more about persisting state with cookies: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
  },
  uiConfig,
);
// ...other stuff in the file
```

# What's next?

Now you can setup your application's logic and UI to handle authentication! You'll be able to integrate authentication in one of two ways:

1. [With our UI components](/react/ui-components) to handle the entire authentication flow.
2. [With our React hooks](/react/react-hooks) to build your own custom UI.
