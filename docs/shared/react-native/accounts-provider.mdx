Now set up and configure the Alchemy Accounts Provider in your project.

You can do this by wrapping the top level component (e.g. `_layout.tsx` in Expo or `App.tsx` in Bare React Native) in your app with the `AlchemyAccountsProvider` component from the `@account-kit/react-native` package.

Here's an example of how to do this:

<CodeBlocks>

<Markdown src="../../../../shared/react-native/account-provider-setup.mdx" />

</CodeBlocks>

## Next Steps
