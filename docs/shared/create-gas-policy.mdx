A gas manager policy is a set of rules that define which UOs are eligible for gas sponsorship. You can control which operations are eligible for sponsorship by defining rules:

- **Spending rules**: limit the amount of money or the number of user ops that can be sponsored by this policy
- **Allowlist**: restrict wallet addresses that are eligible for sponsorship. The policy will only sponsor gas for UOs that were sent by addresses on this list.
- **Blocklist**: ban certain addresses from receiving sponsorship under this policy
- **Policy duration**: define the duration of your policy and the sponsorship expiry period. This is the period for which the Gas Manager signature (paymaster data) will remain valid once it is generated.

Once you have decided on policy rules for your app, [create a policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create/?a=ak-docs) in the Gas Manager dashboard.

Now you should have a Gas policy created with a policy id you can use to sponsor gas for your users.
