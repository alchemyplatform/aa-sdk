Network fees can change quickly. When fees rise, pending transactions may become underpriced and stop progressing. Without retries, these transactions may never confirm. To keep your app reliable, you should use retries.

**Why retries matter**

- Production reliability: Proper wait and retry mechanisms ensure transactions don’t get stuck and fail silently.
- Fee volatility: Gas markets fluctuate constantly, especially on testnets, so transactions can become underpriced and take much longer to mine.
- Automatic recovery: With retries, you can automatically replace stuck transactions with higher fees so they continue to progress.

## How it works

Drop and replace resubmits a transaction with whichever is greater:

- 10% higher fees
- The current minimum fees

The SDK exports a 'dropAndReplace' function from' @aa-sdk/core.' It’s already included in the Smart Account Client, so you can use it directly.

Here’s a common production flow:

1. Send a transaction with 'sendUserOperation'
2. Wait for confirmation using 'waitForUserOperationTransaction'
3. If waiting times out, call 'dropAndReplace' to resend the transaction with higher fees

<Warning>
  If you sponsor gas, each retry creates a pending gas sponsorship in your
  dashboard. - Pending sponsorships expire after 10 minutes of inactivity. -
  Excessive retries can temporarily exhaust your sponsorship limit.
