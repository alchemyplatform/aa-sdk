## What is drop and replace?

If fees change and your transaction gets stuck in the mempool, use drop and replace to resend the transaction with higher fees. This works best with [`waitForUserOperationTransaction`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/waitForUserOperationTransaction) to ensure the transaction is mined; if waiting times out, resend the transaction with higher fees.

Drop and replace works by resubmitting the transaction with the greater of:

1. 10% higher fees
2. The current minimum fees

The `dropAndReplace` function in `@aa-sdk/core` handles this flow and is automatically available on the `Smart Account Client`.

## How to drop and replace effectively

The example below uses drop and replace when waiting for a transaction to mine times out.

<Warning>
  If sponsoring gas, like in the example below, each call to `sendUserOperation`
  and `dropAndReplace` generates pending gas sponsorships in your dashboard.
  This can result in you hitting your sponsorship limit. Pending sponsorships
  expire after 10 minutes of inactivity, but retrying excessively can
  temporarily exhaust your sponsorship limits.
</Warning>
