  *How it works:* To enable this capability you will need to create a Gas
  Manager policy. When a user pays for gas with an ERC-20 token, we front the
  gas using the network's native gas token and transfer the ERC-20 tokens from
  the user's wallet to a wallet you control. The equivalent USD amount and the
  admin fee is then added to your monthly invoice.
