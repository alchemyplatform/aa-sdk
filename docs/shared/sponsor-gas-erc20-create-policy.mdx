To enable your users to pay gas using an ERC-20 token, you need to create a "Pay gas with any token" Policy via the [Gas Manager dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create). You can customize the policy with the following:

- Receiving address: an address of your choosing where the users' ERC20 tokens will be sent to as they pay for gas (this is orchestrated by the paymaster contract and happens automatically at the time of the transaction).
- Tokens: the tokens the user should be able to pay gas with. Learn more [here](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/gas-manager-faqs).
- ERC-20 transfer mode: select whether the user should pay for the gas before or after the userOp execution.
  - [Recommended] After: Enables the user to allow the paymaster contract to spend the ERC-20 token on their behalf (`approve()`) without a separate tx, improving UX. If the transfer fails, the userOp will revert but you'll remain liable for the gas costs.
  - Before: Requires the paymaster contract to have allowance onchain before the userOp gets submitted. If the allowance doesn't exist, the userOp will fail immediately.
- Sponsorship expiry period: this is the period for which the Gas Manager signature and ERC-20 exchange rate will remain valid once generated.

Now you should have a Gas policy created with a policy id you can use to enable gas payments with ERC-20 tokens.
