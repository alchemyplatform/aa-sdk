The Alchemy Signer is a `SmartAccountSigner` that is protected by Alchemy's Signer Infrastructure. Using the Alchemy Signer, you can get started building embedded accounts with just an Alchemy API key!

When using Account Kit with React via `@account-kit/react` or `@account-kit/core`, the assumption is that you're using the Alchemy Signer with our smart contract implementations and our Bundler and Gas Manager infrastructure.
However, you can also use the Alchemy Signer as a standalone signer with your own smart contracts or 3rd party infrastructure. In these guides, you'll learn more about how to choose a signer and how to use our signer directly via
the `@account-kit/signer` package to log users in with email auth, and create a embedded account with our signer to enable email, passkeys (i.e. biometrics), and soon social auth flows!

<Tip>
The Alchemy Signer requires the use of an `iframe`, so must be used in the context of an application. You'll need to build your own custom frontend.
