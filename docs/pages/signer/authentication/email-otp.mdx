# Email OTP Authentication

Email OTP authentication allows you to log in and sign up users using an email address. Your users will receive six-digit code in their inbox which they can enter in your site to complete login.

<Tip>
  For setting up an account config, see the [Signer
  Quickstart](/wallets/signer/quickstart).

## Authenticate a user

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

// send the email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  emailMode: "otp",
  email: "user@mail.com",
});

// later once the user has entered the code from their email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "otp",
  otpCode: "123456",
