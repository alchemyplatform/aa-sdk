# Add Passkey

If your user has already authenticated with an email or passkey, you can also add a new passkey to their account. This is
useful in the case that you want to give your users a more convenient method of logging in or if they want to add more devices
to their account.

## Add a passkey

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

// NOTE: this assumes you have already authenticated the user
// you can further customize the Credential Creation Options here
await signer.addPasskey({});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>
