Social login authentication allows you to log in and sign up users using an OAuth provider, such as Google Sign-In or Facebook Login. You can also configure custom providers through Auth0.

<Tip>
  To set up configurations to enable social login, see the [Signer
  Quickstart](/wallets/signer/quickstart) to enable a social policy in the
  dashboard.

  mode: "redirect", // Alternatively, you can choose "popup" mode
  redirectUrl: "/", // After logging in, redirect to the index page
});
