**Offchain policies** are a set of rules enforced by our secure wallet infrastructure that define the allowed or denied transactions on a smart wallet.

An offchain policy is defined by the following schema:

```tsx
type Policy = {
  version: "1.0";
  // Allows you to assign a human readable name
  // for your policy
  name: string;
  vm_kind: "EVM" | "SVM";
  // This is the account that this policy targets
  account: string;
  // This is the list of rules that will be enforced
  // when the policy is evaluated
  // The supported rules differ based on the network
  rules: Rule[];
};
```

## Rules

A rule defines the specific conditions that must be met for a given Wallet API method.

```tsx
type Rule =
  | {
      name: string;
      type: "methods";
      action: "ALLOW" | "DENY";
      method:
        | "eth_signTransaction" // EVM only
        | "sign_operation" // EVM only
        | "wallet_prepareCalls" // EVM only https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/758
        | "wallet_sendPreparedCalls" // EVM only https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/758
        | "signAndSendTransaction" // SVM only
        | "sendTransaction"; // SVM only
      conditions: Condition[];
    }
  | {
      type: "recipients";
      action: "ALLOW" | "DENY";
      address: string[];
    }
  | {
      type: "contracts";
      action: "ALLOW" | "DENY";
      address: string[];
    };
```

## Conditions

Conditions give you the flexibility to compose multiple requirements that must be met for a given Rule. All conditions must be met in order for the Rule to be enforced.

```tsx
type Condition =
  | {
      type: "field";
      // This specifies where to evaluate the condition
      // for EVM. `call` gives you the most flexibility
      // on enforcement.
      field_source:
        | "call" // EVM only
        | "user_operation" // EVM only
        | "eth_transaction" // EVM only
        | "solana_transaction" // Solana only
        | "solana_instruction" // Solana only
        | "spl_transaction"; // Solana only
      field: string;
      // should only be set when the field_source is `call`
      // and field is `data`
      abi?: JSON;
      comparator: "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "in";
      // the value to compare the field against
      value: string | number | string[];
    }
  | {
      type: "batch_value";
      max_batch_value: string;
    }
  | {
      type: "gas_limit";
      max_gas_limit: string;
    };
```

The following Fields are supported for a given `field_source`

| Field Source         | Supported Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `call`               | `to`, `data`, `value`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `user_operation`     | The fields here are all of the fields that are defined in a User Operation Request that would be submitted to the bundler. This depends on the EntryPoint version. Most Conditions can be defined by using the above `call` source instead though. This field_source is useful for enforcing gas limits, fee limits, etc |
| `eth_transaction`    | Any of the fields that are included in an Ethereum Transaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `solana_transaction` | Any of the fields that are included in a Solana Transaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `solana_instruction` | Any of the fields defined in a Solana instruction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `spl_transaction`    | When a Solana transaction is detected to include an SPL token transaction, this allows enforcing the token transaction based on the `spl_transfer_recipient`, `spl_transfer_value`, `spl_token_address`                                                                                                                  |
