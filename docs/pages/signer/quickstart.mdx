# Signer Quickstart

Getting started with the Signer is very similar to [getting started with React](/react/quickstart).

## Get your API key and create an account config

<GetApiKeysSnippet />

## Install the Signer package

**Prerequisites**

- minimum Typescript version of 5
- pin viem to 2.20.0 (`yarn add viem@2.20.0`)

**Installation**

<CodeBlocks>

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @account-kit/signer
```

```bash [npm]
yarn add @account-kit/signer
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Create a signer instance

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```

## Authenticate a user

Next, you'll need to authenticate your user before you can use the Signer as an owner on the account.

<Tip>
  In this example, we use email auth, but we support a number of other auth
  methods. See the other guides for more examples.
</Tip>

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { signer } from "./signer";

const result = await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  email: "example@mail.com",
});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Use signer as owner on Smart Account

Now that you have authenticated your user, you can use the signer as an owner on a Smart Contract Account.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { createLightAccount } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { http } from "viem";
import { signer } from "./signer";

const account = await createLightAccount({
  signer,
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: http(`${sepolia.rpcUrls.alchemy.http[0]}/API_KEY`),
});
```

```ts twoslash [signer] filename="signer.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/signer/signer.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>
