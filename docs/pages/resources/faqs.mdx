## Smart Accounts - Light Account

### Do accounts have the same address across all chains?

<Accordion title="Answer">
In almost all cases, yes, you will get the same address on all chains as long as the connecting signer address is the same! The deployment address is a function of the address of owner/signer address, the account implementation (e.g. latest version of Light Account), and the salt (you can optionally specify this). If all three of those remain the same, then you deploy the smart account at the same contract address.

There are two scenarios where you would get a different contract address:

1. If you deploy one smart account, then change the signer, then deploy the second account.
2. If you upgrade the smart account (e.g. to a new version of Light Account). It is unlikely that we will make many updates to this contract so the address will not change frequently.

</Accordion>

### How does a smart account get deployed?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Your smart account will be deployed when the first `UserOperation` (UO) is
  sent from the account. The first UO must be sent with a non-zero `initCode`.
  aa-sdk will handle generation of this `initCode` for you using
  [`getAccountInitCode`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/toSmartContractAccount).
</Accordion>

### How can I upgrade a Light Account?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  It is unlikely you will need to frequently update the Light Account contract
  itself, however it is possible if needed. Light Account has
  [`UUPSUpgradeable`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/src/LightAccount.sol#L50)
  which adds upgrade methods on the account itself. To upgrade an account you
  will need to send a `UserOperation` using the method `upgradeTo` or
  `upgradeToAndCall`, depending on whether or not you need to initialize the new
  implementation.
</Accordion>

### Can I have multiple accounts for the same signer address? / How do I set the value of the salt for Light Account?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Yes! The optional salt value on Light Account enables the ability to have
  multiple accounts under a single signer. This value defaults to 0. You can set
  it when you create [light account](#TODO).
</Accordion>

### How can I upgrade from Simple Account to Light Account?

<Accordion title="Answer">
[Simple Account's](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) support [`upgradeToAndCall`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4e7e6e54daedf091d91f2f2df024cbb8f253e2ef/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L86) implemented by openzeppelin [UUPSUpgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable) contract. This allows you to upgrade from Simple Account to Light Account without changing the smart contract account address. Using `upgradeToAndCall` will update the underlying implementation contract on the account while the account address and assets will stay the same.

You can call `upgradeToAndCall` on the Simple Account with these params:

- `newImplementation`: Latest LightAccount implementation address (found [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/Deployments.md#lightaccount) - make sure to use the implementation address, not the factory address)
  - For example LightAccount v1.1.0 - 0xae8c656ad28F2B59a196AB61815C16A0AE1c3cba
- `data`: encoded version of the `initialize` function with `anOwner` parameter set to the owner on the account, usually the same owner as what the account used as Simple Account.
  - In solidity (foundry) you can use abi.encodeCall and in viem you can use [encodeFunctionData](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/blob/main/Deployments.md#lightaccount)

It is very important that the `initialize` step is encoded correctly to ensure the account does not get into a risky state where someone else could call initialize on it with one's signer and take control of your account. You can call `owner()` on the account after the upgrade to ensure it is assigned correctly.

This can be called on the existing smart contract account by sending a user operation that calls `execute` (or `executeBatch`) and has that call `upgradeToAndCall` (the same way you would make the account send calls to other addresses).

</Accordion>

## Submitting `UserOperation`s

### How does the speed of `UserOperation`s compare to normal transactions?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  If the `UserOperation` (meta-transaction for 4337 accounts) is correctly
  priced and submitted a few hundred milliseconds prior to a new block getting
  created, it will typically get placed in the next block. This is because the
  Bundler needs time to create/propagate its transaction. You can think of it as
  1 extra block time worth of latency, but we are working towards improving this
  latency.
</Accordion>

### Why am I seeing a delay in landing `UserOperation`s on-chain?

<Accordion title="Answer">
This can happen when `UserOperation`s (UOs) become underpriced, frequently due to fee market movement between when gas and fees are estimations and when the UO is actually submitted.

You may experience this when calling the [`waitForUserOperationTransaction`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/waitForUserOperationTransaction) method. It may throw an error if it does not find the UO in a mined Transaction within its retry limits.

You can mitigate this by defining a more flexible retry period when constructing a [`Client`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/createSmartAccountClient) (i.e. `txMaxRetries`, `txRetryIntervalMs`, `txRetryMultiplier` in `opts`). If your UO continues to be delayed beyond a limit you are willing to wait, you can resubmit it using [`dropAndReplaceUserOperation`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/dropAndReplaceUserOperation).

</Accordion>

### Are `UserOperation`s protected from MEV bots?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Right now, `UserOperation`s are sent to a private mempool for all networks
  other than Polygon, where there is no way to do this. We are actively involved
  in proposals for a peer-to-peer mempool standard.
</Accordion>

### Can I simulate `UserOperation`s the same way I simulate transactions?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Yes! Check out [this guide](#TODO/react/simulate-user-operations).
</Accordion>

## Gas Estimation

### How does gas estimation for 4337 smart contract accounts work?

<Accordion title="Answer">
Our bundler estimates gas and submits `UserOperation`s (UOs) under the hood of the aa-sdk. Our gas estimations are just that, estimations that optimize for UOs landing on chain, and you may need to adjust gas limits based on your needs using [overrides](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/v4.x.x/aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#L97).

Learn more about gas estimation and how it is implemented in our [Bundler](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/erc-4337-gas-estimation).

There are many nuances and edge cases that our bundler considers especially for L2’s. Learn more [here](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/l2-gas-and-signature-aggregators).

We recommend adding error handling when sending a UO to handle potential gas and fee changes due to market movement. Learn more about [frequent errors](#common-errors).

</Accordion>

## Gas Manager

### What tiers support gas sponsorship?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Gas sponsorship is available on testnet for all tiers. For support on mainnet,
  you must be on a paying tier (i.e. Growth tier and above). Learn more about
  our different pricing tiers
  [here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/gas-manager-coverage-api-pricing#fee-logic).
</Accordion>

### How is gas sponsored? Do I need to fund the Gas Manager?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  We front the gas for your application and put the USD equivalent on your bill
  at the end of the month. No need to worry about pre-funding the Gas Manager or
  conversions, we’ve got you covered! You can follow [this guide](#TODO) for
  more details on how to sponsor `UserOperation`s.
</Accordion>

### What are my gas sponsorship limits?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  You can find details of Gas Manager limits depending on your tier
  [here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/gas-manager-coverage-api-pricing#fee-logic).
</Accordion>

### Do you support ERC-20 or stablecoin paymasters?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Currently, we don’t support this, but we are actively exploring. Please [reach
  out](/wallets/resources/contact-us) if you are interested as we would love
  your input in our spec.
</Accordion>

### How is the Gas Manager protected from DDOS attacks?

<Accordion title="Answer">
  In your Gas Manager policy, you can configure spending rules per address, per
  app, and/or policy wide limits. See how to set up these policies
  [here](#TODO).
</Accordion>

### How to Authenticate Users and Verify User Sessions on the Backend?

<Accordion title="Answer">
    After a user logs in with Smart Wallets on the frontend, you might want to verify their identity on your backend to authorize actions or access.

    You can do this using one of two approaches:

    ---

    ### Option 1: SIWE [Sign-In With Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)

    Use this flow when you just need to verify user sessions created by EOAs and Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs) via Smart Wallets.

    For EOAs, Smart Wallets doesn’t create a session on the client side and `stampWhoAmI` isn’t available, so we can use SIWE. This can be used for verifying EOA and SCA flows.
    You can create a [SIWE message](https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/creating-siwe-messages) with all the necessary info to get server side (address, chainId, etc).

    1. The backend provides a nonce to the frontend.
    2. The user signs a SIWE message with their wallet (EOA or SCA).
    3. The frontend sends the signed message back to the backend.
    4. The backend verifies the signature:
    - EOAs: Standard signature recovery
    - SCAs: Use EIP-1271 or EIP-6492 to verify the contract signature
    5. The backend issues a session token.

    **Note:**
    - SIWE requires an explicit signature from the user, which [costs](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/compute-unit-costs) more than calling `whoami`
    - For verifying both EOA and SCA user sessions

    ---

    ### Option 2: `stampWhoAmI` + `whoami` (Only when using Alchemy signer)

    Use this flow when you just need to verify user sessions created by SCAs via Smart Wallets.

    1. The frontend generates a stamped request using [signer.inner.stampWhoAmI](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/signer/classes/BaseSignerClient/stampWhoami).
    2. It sends the stamp to your backend.
    3. The backend calls Alchemy's [/signer/v1/whoami](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/smart-wallets/signer-api-endpoints/signer-api-endpoints/auth-user) endpoint to verify the identity.
    4. If you need to make subsequent requests, you can also avoid calling the whoami endpoint on every request. To do so, after verifying the `whoami`, the backend can issue its own session token (e.g. an HTTP-only cookie or access token). If the token is present, you can safely skip the `whoami` check.

    **Why this approach?**
    - No user signature required
    - **Cheaper** than flows requiring a signed message
    - Easily retrieve user's login info, such email and address if available

</Accordion>

## Common Errors

### Replacement underpriced: `"code":-32602,"message":"replacement underpriced","data"...`

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Replacement underpriced errors occur when you attempt to send another user
  operation (UO) from the same sender before the pending user operation has been
  confirmed on-chain. Please follow recommendations
  [here](https://www.alchemy.com/support/how-to-fix-replacement-underpriced-errors).
</Accordion>

### `FailedToFindTransactionError: Failed to find transaction for user operation...`

<Accordion title="Answer">
Please follow [this](https://www.alchemy.com/support/best-practice-guide-on-how-to-implement-user-operation-retries) guide for best practices on implementing waiting and retries.

This error indicates that your User Operation has not yet landed on chain (assuming it was accepted by the bundler). We recommend you 1) continue waiting or 2) drop and replace and 3) add multiplier to gas esitmates to increase the priority of your transaction.

</Accordion>

### Invalid policy ID: `{ code: -32602, message: 'Invalid Policy ID' }`

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Gas Manager policies can only be tied to one app. Make sure you are using the
  API Key that is associated with the app the Gas Manager policy is configured
  for, or create a new policy for the app you are using.
</Accordion>

### Precheck failed: `{ code: -3200, message: 'precheck failed: ...' }`

<Accordion title="Answer">
Precheck failed errors are often related to gas and/or fees. Our Bundler follows standard [ERC 4337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4337.md#client-behavior-upon-receiving-a-useroperation) implementation for gas and fee checks in order to 1) ensure your `UserOperation`s (UOs) land on chain and to 2) protect the Bundler from potential attacks in order to support scalability.

These errors are often related to market movement between the time when gas and fees are estimated and the time when UOs are submitted to the bundler. This fluctuation in the market is especially variant on testnet. To ensure your UO is included in a block, we currently reject sending any UOs that are underpriced compared to the network rate .

To handle these errors, we recommend you use our [override fields](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/v4.x.x/aa-sdk/core/src/types.ts#L97) to increase buffers on top of our estimates and implement retry mechanisms as needed.

Our gas and fee estimations are just that, estimations, but we are always working to improve these estimates!

</Accordion>

### Total execution gas limit exceeded: `{ code: -3202, message: 'precheck failed: total execution gas is X but must be at most 10000000}`

<Accordion title="Answer">
  Currently our Bundler allows max 10M gas in aggregate between
  `preVerificationGas`, `verificationGasLimit`, and `callGasLimit`. To reduce
  the gas needed, try reducing the size of your call data and/or sending your
  call data in multiple `UserOperation`s rather than one.
</Accordion>

### `waitForUserOperationTransaction` timeout

<Accordion title="Answer">
[`waitForUserOperationTransaction`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/waitForUserOperationTransaction) may throw this error if it does not find the mined User Operation within its retry limits.

You can mitigate this by defining a more flexible retry period when constructing a [`Client`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/createSmartAccountClient) (i.e. `txMaxRetries`, `txRetryIntervalMs`, `txRetryMultiplier` in `opts`).

If your `UserOperation` continues to be delayed beyond a limit you are willing to wait, you can resubmit the user operation using [`dropAndReplaceUserOperation`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/functions/dropAndReplaceUserOperation#usage).

</Accordion>

### `Although one or more Error Occurred [execution reverted] Contract Execution Completed` on etherscan

<Accordion title="Answer">
  This revert warning message is expected when using Modular Account v1. In
  MAv1, we have a checker that enforces that calls made using the account (from
  `execute` or `executeBatch`) don't target plugin contracts. When the contract
  being called to isn't a plugin (which is usually the case), the checker
  reverts, and it shows this message in explorers.
</Accordion>

### `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` when loading the page

<Accordion title="Answer">
  This message is usually triggered by browser ad‑blocking tools that stop our
  analytics scripts from running. Analytics collection will be blocked, but the
  Smart Wallet functionality will continue to work normally.
</Accordion>

## Other Support

### Does the aa-sdk repo support React Native?

No, the `aa-sdk` repo does not offically support React Native. **It is on our radar!**

Currently we have a strong dependency on Viem, which requires several global features, such as `TextEncoder` and `crypto`, that are absent in React Native's environment. See more about [Viem's capability here](https://viem.sh/docs/compatibility).

However, we have created a small PoC using Expo that you can find [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk-rn-expo/tree/main). For more information on how to use Smart Wallets within a React Native application see [the guide](/wallets/react-native/overview).

### How should I protect my api key and policy id in the frontend?

**Why is it important to protect my API key and Policy ID?**

To prevent unauthorized use or abuse of your API key and Policy ID, it’s critical to avoid exposing them on the frontend. If these credentials are exposed, they could be misused, leading to unintended usage or sponsorship.

Gas sponsorship requests will only succeed if both the Policy ID and the corresponding API key are used together. While protecting your API key alone renders the Policy ID useless to malicious actors, the best security practice is to protect both.

**How can I protect my API Key?**
We recommend moving your API key to the backend by routing to a proxy. You can see an [example](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/ef7303333830df53a9106ba37ce015675a276cd9/examples/ui-demo/src/app/config.tsx#L74) of setting up a transport to a backend rpcUrl in our demo app.

For more information on how to secure your API key, refer to [this guide](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/best-practices-for-key-security-and-management).

<Warning>
  If you have logic in your proxy that restricts certain paths, ensure that the
  relative paths for network-agnostic RPC requests and signer API requests ([see
  example
  here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/14187f8b87224d8730da2919575ac753626461eb/examples/ui-demo/src/app/api/rpc/%5B...routes%5D/route.ts#L21)),
  and network-specific RPC requests ([see example
  here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/14187f8b87224d8730da2919575ac753626461eb/examples/ui-demo/src/app/api/rpc/route.ts))
  are preserved when forwarding.
</Warning>

**How can I protect my Policy ID?**

Protecting your Policy ID requires some custom work, but it’s similar to safeguarding any key on the backend. One solution is to use a proxy server that holds both the API key and Policy ID. In the frontend, when creating an Alchemy client, pass the proxy server URL as the RPC URL instead of a public Alchemy URL.

Additionally, you'll need to implement custom code on your proxy server to limit gas sponsorship requests. This could include rules that make sense for your app, such as limiting gas fees, restricting certain contract or method calls, or implementing limits based on IP addresses or CAPTCHA verification.

### Why are my users getting logged out unexpectedly?

**Issue:**  
You or your users might notice that the session ends sooner than expected, requiring re-authentication.

**Default behavior:**  
By default, authenticated sessions using `AlchemyWebSigner` are stored in `localStorage` and expire after **15 minutes** of inactivity.

---

#### ✅ Solution: Extend or configure session duration

You can customize the session timeout by passing a `sessionConfig` object to the `createConfig` method:

```ts
createConfig({
  ...,
  sessionConfig: {
    expirationTimeMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour session duration (defaults to 15 min)
  },
})
```

👉 [Reference: createConfig](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/functions/createConfig)

---

#### 🧪 Other common causes of session ending:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) misconfigured**
  If you're using SSR and haven't configured the provider correctly, session state can reset on the client.
  👉 [Enable SSR and pass initial params →](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/react/ssr)

- **Ad blockers**
  Some ad blockers (especially those with aggressive cookie or storage policies) can interfere with localStorage or SDK requests, causing unexpected logouts.

- **Private/incognito mode**
  Browsers often restrict or wipe localStorage between tabs or after a short time in incognito mode. Consider warning users or designing for short session lengths in those environments.

---

#### 🔁 Debugging Checklist

If you're seeing repeated or sporadic logouts in production, test the behavior across:

- Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Devices (desktop vs mobile)
- Browsing modes (incognito vs standard)
- With and without ad blockers
