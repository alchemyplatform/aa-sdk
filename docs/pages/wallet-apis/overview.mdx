# Wallet APIs Overview

The Wallet APIs provide a powerful interface for programmatically managing smart wallets and executing transactions. Through the `@account-kit/wallet-client` package, developers can integrate smart account functionality directly into their applications with full control over wallet operations.

## What are Wallet APIs?

Wallet APIs are a set of programmatic interfaces that enable developers to:

- **Create and manage smart wallets** - Programmatically create new smart accounts and manage existing ones
- **Execute transactions** - Prepare, sign, and send transactions through smart accounts
- **Handle signatures** - Sign messages and typed data using smart account capabilities
- **Manage permissions** - Grant and revoke permissions for wallet operations
- **Discover accounts** - List and request access to existing smart accounts

## Why use Wallet APIs?

The Wallet APIs are ideal when you need:

### Direct Control

Full programmatic control over wallet operations without UI components or framework-specific abstractions.

### Backend Integration

Perfect for server-side applications, automated systems, or custom wallet implementations.

### Custom Experiences

Build entirely custom wallet experiences tailored to your specific use case.

### Advanced Features

Access to advanced smart account features like batched transactions, permission management, and custom validation logic.

## Key Components

### SmartWalletClient

The main client interface that provides all wallet functionality:

```typescript
import { createSmartWalletClient } from "@account-kit/wallet-client";

const client = createSmartWalletClient({
  // Configuration options
});
```

### Actions

Individual functions for specific wallet operations:

- `createAccount` - Create new smart accounts
- `prepareCalls` - Prepare transactions for execution
- `signMessage` - Sign messages with smart accounts
- `grantPermissions` - Manage wallet permissions
