Smart Wallets is designed to be flexible and allow you to use any Signer you want. If you choose not use our signer, you can either:

1. Use a 3rd party library as a Signer that integrates with Smart Wallets.
1. Implement [`SmartAccountSigner`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/packages/core/src/signer/types.ts#L34) (exported in `@aa-sdk/core`).
1. If your Signer is an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compliant provider, you can leverage `viem`'s `WalletClient` and the [`WalletClientSigner`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/classes/WalletClientSigner/constructor) (exported in `@aa-sdk/core`).

Then you can use your Signer as an owner on Smart Contracts exported from `@account-kit/smart-contracts` and with our infra Smart Account Clients exported from `@account-kit/infra`.

## Third Party SDKs

<Tip>
If you've built an SDK or Guide that leverages any of the methods below to use as a 3rd Party Signer, we're happy to include you in this list!


- Leverage [Para](https://www.getpara.com/) with Alchemy AA SDK. Follow instructions [here](https://docs.getpara.com/v2/react/guides/web3-operations/evm/smart-accounts/setup-libraries#alchemy-account-kit)

## Implementing `SmartAccountAuthenticator` or `SmartAccountSigner`

Smart accounts in Smart Wallets expect an implementation of `SmartAccountSigner` to work in Smart Wallets. We also include a `SmartAccountAuthenticator` interface that extends `SmartAccountSigner` and wraps any SDKs you may wish to use as part of the implementation of your own Signer.

```ts types.ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../aa-sdk/core/src/signer/types.ts]
```

## Using `WalletClientSigner`

Viem allows you to create a `WalletClient`, which can be used to wrap local or JSON RPC based wallets. You can see the complete docs for leveraging the `WalletClient` [here](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet).

We support a `SmartAccountSigner` implementation called `WalletClientSigner` that makes it really easy to use a viem `WalletClient` as a signer on your Smart Contract Account. If your Signer is [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compliant, it is really easy to use with `WalletClient`. Let's take a look at a simple example:
