# How to use your own Account Signer

Account Kit is designed to be flexible and allow you to use any Signer you want. If you choose not use our signer, you can either:

1. Use a 3rd party library as a Signer that integrates with Account Kit.
1. Implement [`SmartAccountSigner`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/packages/core/src/signer/types.ts#L34) (exported in `@aa-sdk/core`).
1. If your Signer is an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compliant provider, you can leverage `viem`'s `WalletClient` and the [`WalletClientSigner`](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/classes/WalletClientSigner/constructor) (exported in `@aa-sdk/core`).

Then you can use your Signer as an owner on Smart Contracts exported from `@account-kit/smart-contracts` and with our infra Smart Account Clients exported from `@account-kit/infra`.

## Third Party SDKs

<Tip>
If you've built an SDK or Guide that leverages any of the methods below to use as a 3rd Party Signer, we're happy to include you in this list!

## Implementing `SmartAccountAuthenticator` or `SmartAccountSigner`

Smart accounts in Account Kit expect an implementation of `SmartAccountSigner` to work in Account Kit. We also include a `SmartAccountAuthenticator` interface that extends `SmartAccountSigner` and wraps any SDKs you may wish to use as part of the implementation of your own Signer.

```ts [types.ts] twoslash
import type { Address } from "abitype";
import type {
  Hex,
  SignableMessage,
  TypedData,
  TypedDataDefinition,
} from "viem";
import type { Authorization } from "viem/experimental";

// [!region SmartAccountAuthenticator]
/**
 * Extends the @interface SmartAccountSigner interface with authentication.
 *
 * @template AuthParams - the generic type of the authentication parameters
 * @template AuthDetails - the generic type of the authentication details
 * @template Inner - the generic type of the inner client that the signer wraps to provide functionality such as signing, etc.
 */
export interface SmartAccountAuthenticator<AuthParams, AuthDetails, Inner = any>
  extends SmartAccountSigner<Inner> {
  authenticate: (params: AuthParams) => Promise<AuthDetails>;

  getAuthDetails: () => Promise<AuthDetails>;
}
// [!endregion SmartAccountAuthenticator]

// [!region SmartAccountSigner]
/**
 * A signer that can sign messages and typed data.
 *
 * @template Inner - the generic type of the inner client that the signer wraps to provide functionality such as signing, etc.
 */
export interface SmartAccountSigner<Inner = any> {
  signerType: string;
  inner: Inner;

  getAddress: () => Promise<Address>;

  signMessage: (message: SignableMessage) => Promise<Hex>;

  signTypedData: <
    const TTypedData extends TypedData | Record<string, unknown>,
    TPrimaryType extends keyof TTypedData | "EIP712Domain" = keyof TTypedData
  >(
    params: TypedDataDefinition<TTypedData, TPrimaryType>
  ) => Promise<Hex>;

  signAuthorization?: (
    unsignedAuthorization: Authorization<number, false>
  ) => Promise<Authorization<number, true>>;
}
// [!endregion SmartAccountSigner]

```

## Using `WalletClientSigner`

Viem allows you to create a `WalletClient`, which can be used to wrap local or JSON RPC based wallets. You can see the complete docs for leveraging the `WalletClient` [here](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet).

We support a `SmartAccountSigner` implementation called `WalletClientSigner` that makes it really easy to use a viem `WalletClient` as a signer on your Smart Contract Account. If your Signer is [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compliant, it is really easy to use with `WalletClient`. Let's take a look at a simple example:
