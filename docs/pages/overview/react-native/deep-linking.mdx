If you plan on using email magic link auth or social auth, you'll need to ensure deep linking is properly configured in your app.

Depending on if your app uses `expo-router`, `react-navigation`, or some other navigation library, you'll need to configure deep linking accordingly.

- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/)
