Gas fees paid in the native gas token can feel foreign to users that primarily hold stablecoins or your app’s own token.
With our smart wallet, you can enable your users to pay gas with ERC-20 tokens beyond the native gas token, like USDC or your own custom tokens, streamlining the user experience.

<Info>
  **How it works:** We front the gas using the network’s native gas token and
  transfer the ERC-20 tokens from the user’s wallet to a wallet you control. The
  equivalent USD amount and the admin fee is then added to your monthly invoice.

<Info>
  **\[Recommended]** Use our [SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets) to
  create and use wallets. The SDK handles all complexity for you, making
  development faster and easier.

If you want to use APIs directly, follow these steps.

## Steps

### 1. Get an API key

- Get you API Key by creating an app in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup)
- Make sure you enable the networks you are building on under the Networks tab

### 2. Create a Gas Manager policy

To enable your users to pay gas using an ERC-20 token, you need to create a “Pay gas with any token” Policy via the [Gas Manager dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup). You can customize the policy with the following:

- Receiving address: an address of your choosing where the users' ERC20 tokens will be sent to as they pay for gas (this is orchestrated by the paymaster contract and happens automatically at the time of the transaction).
- Tokens: the tokens the user should be able to pay gas with. Learn more [here](/reference/gas-manager-faqs).
- ERC-20 transfer mode: choose when the user's token payment occurs.
  - [Recommended] After: No upfront allowance is required. The user signs an approval inside the same user operation batch, and the paymaster pulls the token _after_ the operation has executed. If that post-execution transfer fails, the entire user operation is reverted and you still pay the gas fee.
  - Before: You (the developer) must ensure the paymaster already has sufficient allowance—either through a prior `approve()` transaction or a permit signature—_before_ the UserOperation is submitted. If the required allowance isn't in place when the user operation is submitted, it will be rejected upfront.
- Sponsorship expiry period: this is the period for which the Gas Manager signature and ERC-20 exchange rate will remain valid once generated.

Now you should have a Gas policy created with a policy id you can use to enable gas payments with ERC-20 tokens.

### 3. Get Gas Manager’s signature

When sending a userOperation, you can specify the `paymaster` and `paymasterData` fields in the **`userOp`** object. These fields are related to the signature of the Gas Manager that enables the user to pay for gas with ERC-20 tokens.

You can get these fields through [`alchemy_requestGasAndPaymasterAndData`](/docs/wallets/api/gas-manager-admin-api/gas-abstraction-api-endpoints/alchemy-request-gas-and-paymaster-and-data) using your Gas Manager Policy id, the API key of the app associated with the policy, a userOperation, the address of the EntryPoint contract, and the address of the ERC-20 token. You can find an example script below.

### 4. Send the userOp

Once you get the `paymaster` and `paymasterData` fields, you can use them in your userOperation when you call [`eth_sendUserOperation`](https://www.alchemy.com/reference/eth-senduseroperation). You can find an example script below.

## Example script

```ts
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// --- Constants ---

// Address of the ERC-4337 EntryPoint contract
const ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS = "0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789";

// ABI for the EntryPoint contract, specifically for the getNonce function
const ENTRYPOINT_ABI = [
  {
    type: "function",
    name: "getNonce",
    inputs: [
      { name: "sender", type: "address", internalType: "address" },
      { name: "key", type: "uint192", internalType: "uint192" },
    ],
    outputs: [
      {
        name: "nonce",
        type: "uint256",
        internalType: "uint256",
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: "view",
  },
];

// Alchemy RPC URL for Sepolia testnet
const ALCHEMY_RPC_URL = "";
// Alchemy Gas Manager RPC URL for Sepolia testnet
const ALCHEMY_GAS_MANAGER_URL = "";

// Policy ID for the Alchemy Gas Manager
const ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID = "";

// Address of the ERC20 token to be used for gas payment
const ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x1c7d4b196cb0c7b01d743fbc6116a902379c7238"; // USDC

// --- Ethers.js Setup ---

// Initialize a JSON RPC provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(ALCHEMY_RPC_URL);

// Create an ethers.js contract instance for the EntryPoint contract
const entryPoint = new ethers.Contract(
  ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS,
  ENTRYPOINT_ABI,
  provider,
);
