## What is the Gas Manager Admin API?

The Gas Manager Admin API is a REST API with endpoints that allow you to programmatically create, update and manage gas policies. Programmatically managing gas policies is for "power" users with complex use cases who need to manage this process dynamically through code instead of incrementally in the Alchemy Dashboard.

## How to Use the Gas Manager Admin API to Create a Policy

To use Gas Manager Admin API, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Alchemy app**: to create gas policies, you first need to create an Alchemy app [through your Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
2. **Create access keys for your account**: To call Gas Manager Admin APIs, an authorization header is required in all the requests. This `auth` header should be your access key. Follow this [guide for creating access keys](/docs/how-to-create-access-keys).
3. **Create the policy**: Next, make a request to the [Create Policy](/reference/create-policy) endpoint with your policy rules.
