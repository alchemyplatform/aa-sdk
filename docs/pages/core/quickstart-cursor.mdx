If you're not using React, but still want the abstractions that make the React package easy to use, you can leverage the `@account-kit/core` package directly.

In this guide, you'll walk through how to use this package to send transactions, while using the reactive utilities exported by this package.

## Install packages

**Prerequisites**

- minimum Typescript version of 5

**Installation**

To get started, install the required packages. Also install the `infra` package because it contains the necessary `Chain` definitions that make it easier to setup your transaction sending client.

<CodeBlocks>

```bash yarn
yarn add @account-kit/core @account-kit/infra
```

```bash npm
npm i -s @account-kit/core @account-kit/infra
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Get your API keys

<Markdown src="../../shared/get-api-key.mdx" />

## Create a config

Create a config as a static object that you can import anywhere into your application. It contains all of the state that the functions within this package use.

```ts twoslash config.ts
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/core";
import { alchemy, sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" }),
  chain: sepolia,
  // optional if you want to sponsor gas
  policyId: "YOUR_POLICY_ID",
});
```

## Authenticate the user

Before you can create a Smart Account instance for your users, authenticate them. Depending on what framework you're using this will look different, but using email based authentication as an example:

1. collect the user's email
2. call the `authenticate` method on the authentication client
3. handle the redirect from the user's email and pass the bundle to complete login

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { config } from "./config";
import { getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";

const signer = getSigner(config);

if (!signer) {
  // this can happen if rendering this on the server
  // the authentication instance is only available on the client
  throw new Error("Signer not found");
}

// authenticate the user with email
await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  email: "user@email.com",
});

// once the user has clicked on the email and been redirected back to your site
const bundle = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("bundle");
if (!bundle) {
  throw new Error("No bundle found in URL");
}
await signer.authenticate({ type: "email", bundle });
```

## Send transactions

Now that you have your config, send transactions by leveraging the underlying smart account client.

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { watchSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/core";
import { config } from "./config";

let clientState;

// The watch smart account client handles all of the possible state changes
// that can impact this client:
//  - Authentication status
//  - Account instantiation
//  - Chain changes
const clientSubscription = watchSmartAccountClient(
  {
    type: "LightAccount",
  },
  config,
)((clientState_) => {
  clientState = clientState_;
});

if (clientState == null || clientState.isLoadingClient) {
  console.log("Loading...");
}

const client = clientState.client;

await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xtarget",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});
```

The key element here is the `watchSmartAccountClient` method which allows you to subscribe to the state of authentication and underlying account to give you a stable instance of the Smart Account Client. How you store the `clientState` variable will depend largely on your framework, but the above example should give you a good starting point.
