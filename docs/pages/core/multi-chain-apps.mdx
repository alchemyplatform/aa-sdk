# Multi-chain Apps

Account Kit supports multi-chain apps, allowing you to build applications that interact with multiple blockchains. This guide will show you how to set up your app to work with multiple chains.

## Update your config

In order to support multiple chains in your app, the first thing you need to do is update your `createConfig` call to include the chains you want to support.

```ts twoslash
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/core";
import { sepolia, mainnet, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  // use this transport for all chains
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY" }),
  // this is the default chain
  chain: sepolia,
  chains: [
    {
      chain: mainnet,
      // optional: sponsor gas for this chain
      policyId: "MAINNET_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    },
    {
      chain: sepolia,
      // optional: override the default transport for this chain
      transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "OTHER_API_KEY" }),
      // optional: sponsor gas for this chain
      policyId: "SEPOLIA_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    },
  ],
});
```

## Change chains

Once your app is configured to use multiple chains, you can switch between them at any time using the [`setChain`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/core/functions/setChain) function.

<Tip>
  Changing the chain will trigger state changes in your app (eg. the
  `BundlerClient` returned from `getBundlerClient`, the `SmartAccountClient`
  returned from `getSmartAccountClient`, etc). This is why it's important to use
  the various `watch*` methods that subscribe to the state changes that impact
  them.

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { setChain } from "@account-kit/core";
import { mainnet } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { config } from "./config";

await setChain(config, mainnet);
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/core";
import { sepolia, mainnet, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY" }),
  // this is the default chain
  chain: sepolia,
  chains: [
    {
      chain: mainnet,
      // optional: sponsor gas for this chain
      policyId: "MAINNET_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    },
    {
      chain: sepolia,
      // optional: sponsor gas for this chain
      policyId: "SEPOLIA_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    },
  ],
});
```
