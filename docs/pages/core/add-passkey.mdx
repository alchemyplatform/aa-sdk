You may have noticed in the [Authenticate users](/wallets/core/authenticate-users) guide, that it's possible to authenticate users with a passkey they've already created. If you don't want users to have to type in an email to log in with a passkey, this guide will cover how to add a passkey to a user's account once they have already logged in.

## Authenticate the user

See the [Authenticate users](/wallets/core/authenticate-users#email-authentication) guide for more information on how to authenticate a user with email. The user must be authenticated before you can add a passkey to their account

## Add a passkey

Once the user is authenticated, you can use the `addPasskey` method on the Alchemy Signer. In the below example, we add the passkey as soon as the signer is connected. However, you can choose to add a passkey when the user clicks a button or at any other time. In this case, use the `watchSignerStatus` method to change your UI based on the signer's connected status.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { watchSignerStatus, getSigner } from "@account-kit/core";
import { config } from "./config";

const signerSubscription = watchSignerStatus(config)(async (status) => {
  if (status.isConnected) {
    const signer = getSigner(config);

    await signer.addPasskey();
  }
});
```
