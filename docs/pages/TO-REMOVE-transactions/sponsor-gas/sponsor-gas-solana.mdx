Once you've [created](/react/solana-wallets/get-started) a smart wallet on Solana, sponsor Solana transaction fees with your Smart Wallets to enable users to transact without holding SOL. Powered by Smart Wallets, this removes a major barrier to entry for new users of your app.

Implement sponsorship either globally (applying to all transactions) or on a per-transaction basis with policies defining what you want to sponsor for users:

- **Fees** cover the cost of executing transactions.
- **Rent** is required to store data on-chain.
  - _We support rent sponsorship for `createAccount` and `createAssociatedTokenAccount` programs. If you need support for sponsoring rent in custom programs, please contact us at [wallets@alchemy.com](mailto:wallets@alchemy.com)._

See our [recommendations](https://www.alchemy.com/support/best-practices-to-limit-gas-manager-spend) for gas manager spending.

### Create a Gas Manager policy

A gas manager policy defines which transactions are eligible for sponsorship. You can customize the policy to limit the amount of money or the number of transactions that can be sponsored.

You can create a policy in the [Gas Manager dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create/?a=api-docs).

Now you should have a Gas policy created with a policy id you can use to sponsor fees and rent for your users.

    ## Global sponsorship

    To apply a sponsorship policy to all transactions sent by the Solana wallet provider, you can configure fee and rent sponsorship at the Alchemy configuration level by passing a `policyId` into your Solana config. Replace the API key and Policy Id with your keys from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration).

    ```tsx config.ts
    import { cookieStorage, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

    createConfig({
      ...otherConfig
      solana: {
        connection: new Connection(
          "https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<API_KEY>",
          {
            wsEndpoint: "wss://api.devnet.solana.com",
            commitment: "confirmed",
          }
        ),
        policyId: "<PolicyId>"
      }
    }
    ```

    This setup applies sponsorship to all Solana transactions sent from wallets created with this configuration (e.g. this will be applied to usage of the `useSolana…` hooks).

    ### Per transaction sponsorship

    Alternatively, to apply sponsorship conditionally for each transaction, you can pass a `policyId` to the `useSolanaTransaction` hook.

    ```tsx [sponsor-solana-gas.ts]
    import { useSolanaTransaction } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { Connection, PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";

    function MyComponent() {
      const policyId = "<YourPolicyId>";

      const { sendTransaction, signer } = useSolanaTransaction({
        policyId,
      });

      if (!signer) {
        return <div>Loading signer...</div>;
      }

      return (
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            sendTransaction({
              transfer: {
                toAddress: "<ToAddress>",
                amount: 1000000,
              },
            })
          }
        >
          Send Sponsored Transaction
        </button>
      );
    }
    ```

    Congrats! You're now creating smart wallets on Solana with social login and sending sponsored transactions to create a zero-friction experience from sign-up to transaction. Reach out with any feature request or questions.

    ### Prepare a Serialized Solana Transaction

    Here’s an example of creating a serialized transfer transaction using javascript:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript

    const instructions = [
      solanaWeb3.SystemProgram.transfer({
        fromPubkey: from,
        toPubkey: to,
        lamports: amount,
      })
    ];

    const recentBlockHash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
    const message = new solanaWeb3.TransactionMessage({
      payerKey: new solanaWeb3.PublicKey("Amh6quo1FcmL16Qmzdugzjq3Lv1zXzTW7ktswyLDzits"), // Set this to an address different than any other address included in the tx. This field will be updated by the alchemy_requestFeePayer API in Step 3.
      recentBlockhash: recentBlockhash,
      instructions,
    }).compileToV0Message();

        const transaction = new solanaWeb3.VersionedTransaction(message);
        const serializedTx = Buffer.from(transaction.serialize()).toString("base64");

    ````
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Request sponsorship for the Serialized Transaction

    To sponsor fees and rent on Solana, 1) the `payerKey` field of the transaction needs to be set to the feePayer wallet that will pay for the gas, 2) the feePayer wallet needs to sign the transaction.

    You can get the `feePayer` address and the feePayer signature through [alchemy\_requestFeePayer](/reference/alchemy-requestfeepayer) using your gas policy id and the serialized transaction. The Gas Manager will update the `feePayer` and add the signature to the `serializedTransaction` if and only the transaction satisfies the rules defined in your policy.

    ### Sign and broadcast the Transaction

    Here is an example of signing and broadcasting a transaction using javascript:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript javascript
    const tx = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(decodeBase64(serializedTx));
    tx.sign([keypair]);
    const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
    ````

    </CodeGroup>
