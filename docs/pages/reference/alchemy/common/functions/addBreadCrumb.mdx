TODO: need to figure out if there's a better way than this...
This adds a tracing breadcrumb to the client during requests.
It returns a basic client without the previously extended actions.
That means you MUST use viem's `getAction` method within actions in case the action is being called from an action that attached a breadcrumb.
That method works by taking a fallback, looking up the action on the client, if it finds it calls it, otherwise it calls the fallback.

## Import

```ts
import { addBreadCrumb } from "@alchemy/common";
```

## Parameters

### client

`Client<AlchemyTransport>`
a client using the alchemy transport

### breadcrumb

`string`
the breadcrumb to add to the tracing headers

## Returns

`Client<AlchemyTransport>`
a client with the transport updated to include the breadcrumb
