Creates an Alchemy transport with the specified configuration options.
When sending all traffic to Alchemy, you must pass in one of rpcUrl, apiKey, or jwt.
If you want to send Bundler and Paymaster traffic to Alchemy and Node traffic to a different RPC, you must pass in alchemyConnection and nodeRpcUrl.

## Import

```ts
import { alchemy } from "@alchemy/common";
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

If the chain you're using is supported for both Bundler and Node RPCs, then you can do the following:

```ts twoslash
import { alchemy } from "@alchemy/common";

const transport = alchemy({
  // NOTE: you can also pass in an rpcUrl or jwt here or rpcUrl and jwt
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});
```

### AA Only Chains

For AA-only chains, you need to specify the alchemyConnection and nodeRpcUrl since Alchemy only
handles the Bundler and Paymaster RPCs for these chains.

```ts twoslash
import { alchemy } from "@alchemy/common";

const transport = alchemy({
  alchemyConnection: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
  },
  nodeRpcUrl: "https://zora.rpc.url",
});
```

### Split Transport support

Sometimes, the above configuration is still too restrictive and you want to split specific JSON-RPC methods between different transports. We support
this by allowing you to pass in a split transport configuration to make this much simpler.

```ts twoslash
import { alchemy } from "@alchemy/common";

const transport = alchemy({
  // in this example we want to send all eth_chainId requests to a different RPC
  overrides: [
    {
      methods: ["eth_chainId"],
      transport: http("https://rpc2.url"),
    },
  ],
  // the fallback is where all other methods will be sent to
  fallback: http("https://rpc1.url"),
});
```

## Parameters

### config

`AlchemyTransportConfig`
The configuration object for the Alchemy transport.

### config.retryDelay

`number`
Optional The delay between retries, in milliseconds.

### config.retryCount

`number`
Optional The number of retry attempts.

### config.alchemyConnection

`string`
Optional Alchemy connection configuration (if this is passed in, nodeRpcUrl is required).

### config.nodeRpcUrl

`string`
Optional RPC URL for node (if this is passed in, alchemyConnection is required).

### config.overrides

`Array<{methods: string[], transport: Transport}>`
When provided, fallback is also required as this sets up a split transport

### config.fallback

`Transport`
Optionally required if overrides are provided, this is the fallback transport for the split transport config.

### config.restConnection

`string`
Optionally required if overrides are provided rest connection config for the split transport

### config.fetchOptions

`string`
Optional fetch options for HTTP requests.

### config.rpcUrl

`string`
Optional RPC URL.

### config.apiKey

`string`
Optional API key for Alchemy.

### config.jwt

`string`
Optional JSON Web Token for authorization.

## Returns

`AlchemyTransport`
The configured Alchemy transport object.
