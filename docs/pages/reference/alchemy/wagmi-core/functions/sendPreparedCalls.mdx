Signs and sends prepared calls.

This function takes prepared calls (from `prepareSwap` or `prepareCalls`), signs them,
and executes the transaction. Returns prepared call IDs that can be used to track the
execution status.

Notice: If you do not wish to inspect the prepared call data, you can
simply use `sendCalls` instead, which combines preparing, signing, and
sending in a single action.
