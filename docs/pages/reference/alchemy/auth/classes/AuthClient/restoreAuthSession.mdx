description: Overview of the restoreAuthSession method
slug: wallets/reference/alchemy/auth/classes/AuthClient/restoreAuthSession
---

Creates an instance of AuthSession from a previously saved authentication session state that has not expired.

This method takes a JSON string representation of a serialized AuthSessionState (typically obtained
from AuthSession.getSerializedState()) and attempts to restore the authentication session.
The method will validate the session expiration and handle different authentication types appropriately.

For each auth type, it creates a new TurnkeyClient with the appropriate stamper:

- Email/OAuth/OTP: Uses TEK stamper and injects the credential bundle
- Passkey: Uses WebAuthn stamper with the stored credentialId

## Import

```ts
import { AuthClient } from "@alchemy/auth";
```

## Usage

```ts twoslash
// Restore a session from stored JSON string
const sessionJson = localStorage.getItem("authSession");
if (sessionJson) {
  const authSession = await authClient.restoreAuthSession(sessionJson);
  if (authSession) {
    console.log("Session restored successfully");
  } else {
    console.log("Session expired");
  }
}
```

## Parameters

### state

`string`

- The serialized authentication session state as a JSON string

## Returns

`Promise<AuthSession | undefined>`
A promise that resolves to an AuthSession instance if the session is valid and not expired, undefined if expired
