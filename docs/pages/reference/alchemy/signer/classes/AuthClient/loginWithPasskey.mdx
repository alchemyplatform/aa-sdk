Initiates passkey (WebAuthn) authentication flow.

This method uses WebAuthn standards to authenticate users with biometric or hardware security keys.
Can be used for both new passkey creation (when credentialId is undefined) and
authentication with existing passkeys (when credentialId is provided).

## Import

```ts
import { AuthClient } from "@alchemy/auth";
```

## Usage

```ts
// New passkey authentication
const authSession = await authClient.loginWithPasskey();

// Authenticate with existing passkey
const authSession = await authClient.loginWithPasskey("existing-credential-id");
```

## Parameters

### credentialId

`string`

- Optional credential ID for authenticating with existing passkey

## Returns

`Promise<AuthSession>`
Promise that resolves to an auth session instance
