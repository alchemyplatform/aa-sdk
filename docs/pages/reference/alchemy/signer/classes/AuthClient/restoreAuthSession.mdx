description: Overview of the restoreAuthSession method
slug: wallets/reference/alchemy/signer/classes/AuthClient/restoreAuthSession
---

Creates an instance of AuthSession from a previously saved authentication session state that has not expired.

This method takes a JSON string representation of a serialized AuthSessionState (typically obtained
from AuthSession.getAuthSessionState()) and attempts to restore the authentication session.
The method will validate the session expiration and handle different authentication types appropriately.

## Import

```ts
import { AuthClient } from "@alchemy/auth";
```

## Usage

```ts twoslash
// Restore a session from stored JSON string
const sessionJson = localStorage.getItem("authSession");
if (sessionJson) {
  const authSession = await authClient.restoreAuthSession(sessionJson);
  if (authSession) {
    console.log("Session restored successfully");
  } else {
    console.log("Session expired");
  }
}
```

## Parameters

### state

`string`

- The serialized authentication session state as a JSON string

## Returns

`Promise<AuthSession | undefined>`
A promise that resolves to an AuthSession instance if the session is valid and not expired, undefined if expired
