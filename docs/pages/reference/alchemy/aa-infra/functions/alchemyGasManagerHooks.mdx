description: Overview of the alchemyGasManagerHooks method
slug: wallets/reference/alchemy/aa-infra/functions/alchemyGasManagerHooks
---

Creates hooks for integrating Alchemy's Gas Manager with viem's bundler client.

For production use, you must use the `.bind(client)` method to create hooks that can
make RPC calls. For test environments, the spread operator pattern works directly.

## Import

```ts
import { alchemyGasManagerHooks } from "@alchemy/aa-infra";
```

## Usage

```ts
// For production with Alchemy transport:
import { createBundlerClient, createClient, http } from "viem";
import { alchemyGasManagerHooks } from "@account-kit/infra";

const client = createClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: http("https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key"),
});

const gasManagerHooks = alchemyGasManagerHooks("your-policy-id");
const boundHooks = gasManagerHooks.bind(client);

const bundler = createBundlerClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: http("https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key"),
  account,
  ...boundHooks,
});

// For tests with local instances:
const bundler = createBundlerClient({
  chain: local070Instance.chain,
  transport: custom(client),
  account,
  ...alchemyGasManagerHooks("test-policy"),
});
```

## Parameters

### policyId

`string | string[]`

- The policy ID(s) for Alchemy's gas manager

### policyToken

`PolicyToken`

- Optional ERC-20 token configuration for paying gas with tokens

## Returns

`AlchemyGasManagerHooksWithBind`
Hooks with bind method for production use
