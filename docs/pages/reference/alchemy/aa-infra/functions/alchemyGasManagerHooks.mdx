description: Overview of the alchemyGasManagerHooks method
slug: wallets/reference/alchemy/aa-infra/functions/alchemyGasManagerHooks
---

Creates hooks for integrating Alchemy's Gas Manager with viem's bundler client.

This implementation works with viem's paymaster interface for test environments
where the transport layer handles the actual RPC calls. The spread operator pattern
can be used in tests, but production environments may require a different integration
pattern to properly bind the client context.

## Import

```ts
import { alchemyGasManagerHooks } from "@alchemy/aa-infra";
```

## Usage

```ts
// In test environments with local test instances:
import { createBundlerClient } from "viem/account-abstraction";
import { alchemyGasManagerHooks } from "@account-kit/infra";

const bundler = createBundlerClient({
  chain: local070Instance.chain,
  transport: custom(client),
  account,
  ...alchemyGasManagerHooks("test-policy"),
});
```

## Parameters

### policyId

`string | string[]`

- The policy ID(s) for Alchemy's gas manager

### \_policyToken

`PolicyToken`

- Optional ERC-20 token configuration for paying gas with tokens (reserved for future use)

## Returns

`AlchemyGasManagerHooks`
Hooks for createBundlerClient
