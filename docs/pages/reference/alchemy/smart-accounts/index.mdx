The `@alchemy/smart-accounts` package contains all of the definitions for our smart contracts.
This package is designed for developers who want to use our smart contract accounts directly with viem. For a better integration path, we recommend using `@alchemy/wallet-apis`, or a platform-specific package like `@alchemy/react`.
