The `@aa-sdk/core` package contains all of the core interfaces and functions for interacting with any ERC-4337 infrastructure and smart contracts. This package is the
basis for all of the Account Kit packages and is designed to be used by developers who want to build their own integrations with 3rd party services. For the simplest integration
with our products, consider using the `@account-kit/*` packages.
