```

## Usage

```ts
const {
  isPending: isSigningMessage,
  mutate: signHello,
  data: signature,
  reset,
} = useSolanaSignMessage({});
mutate({ message: "Hello" });
```

## Parameters

### opts

`UseSolanaSignMessageParams`

- Options for the hook to get setup.

## Returns

`SolanaSignedMessage`
This should be hook mutations plus a few more. Used to get the end result of the signing and the callbacks.
