Hook for sending calls to a smart account or EOA wallet.

This hook provides functionality to execute calls on a smart account using Account Abstraction,
or fall back to regular EOA transactions when connected to an EOA wallet. It handles the complete
flow of preparing, signing, and sending calls.

<Note>
  If using this hook with an ERC-20 paymaster in pre-operation mode with
  `autoPermit`, the contents of the permit will be hidden from the user. It is
  recommended to use the `usePrepareCalls` hook instead to manually handle the
  permit signature.
</Note>

## Import

```ts
import { useSendCalls } from "@account-kit/react";
```

## Usage

```tsx
const { sendCalls, sendCallsAsync, isSendingCalls, error } = useSendCalls();

// Send a single call
await sendCallsAsync({
  calls: [
    {
      to: "0x...",
      data: "0x...",
      value: "0x0",
    },
  ],
});

// Send multiple calls (smart account only)
await sendCallsAsync({
  calls: [
    { to: "0x...", data: "0x..." },
    { to: "0x...", data: "0x..." },
  ],
});
```

## Parameters

### params

`UseSendCallsParams`
