Defined in: [account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSignAndSendPreparedCalls.ts:86](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/f1e2d1995d71eb8fa365d9b662045e15212c425a/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSignAndSendPreparedCalls.ts#L86)

Hook for signing and sending prepared calls from a smart account.

This hook provides functionality to sign and send previously prepared calls to a smart account.
It handles both the signing and sending of prepared calls in a single operation, and does not support EOA wallets.

## Example

```ts twoslash
import { useSignAndSendPreparedCalls } from "@account-kit/react";

const {
  signAndSendPreparedCalls,
  signAndSendPreparedCallsAsync,
  isSigningAndSendingPreparedCalls,
  error,
} = useSignAndSendPreparedCalls();

// Sign and send prepared calls
await signAndSendPreparedCallsAsync({
  preparedCalls: [
    // unsigned prepared call objects
  ],
});
```
