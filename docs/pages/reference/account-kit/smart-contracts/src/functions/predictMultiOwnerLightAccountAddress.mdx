```ts
function predictMultiOwnerLightAccountAddress(params): `0x${string}`;
```

Defined in: [account-kit/smart-contracts/src/light-account/accounts/predictAddress.ts:117](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/17aad1f572375d42a06c7e3238078a88a435d459/account-kit/smart-contracts/src/light-account/accounts/predictAddress.ts#L117)

Predicts the address of a **Multi-Owner Light Account** given the factory, salt
and the set of owner addresses.

Internally replicates the CREATE2 calculation performed by the factory so
you can obtain the counter-factual account address before deployment (useful
for funding or displaying to users).
