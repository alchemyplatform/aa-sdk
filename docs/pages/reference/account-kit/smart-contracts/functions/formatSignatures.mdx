Formats a collection of Signature objects into a single aggregated signature.
The format is in the form of EOA_SIGS | CONTRACT_SIG_DATAS. The signatures are ordered
by signer address. The EOA SIGS contain the 65 signautre data for EOA signers and 65 bytes containing SIGNER | OFFSET | V for contract signers.
The OFFSET is used to fetch the signature data from the CONTRACT_SIG_DATAS.
