const client = createModularAccountAlchemyClient(...);

const hash = await installPlugin(client, {
pluginAddress: "0x...",
manifestHash: "0x...",
dependencies: [], // this is defined by the plugin you're installing
});
```

## Parameters

`Client<TTransport, TChain, TAccount>`
The client configured to the smart account on which the plugin will be installed

### params
