---

Predicts the address of a **Multi-Owner Light Account** given the factory, salt
and the set of owner addresses.

Internally replicates the CREATE2 calculation performed by the factory so
you can obtain the counter-factual account address before deployment (useful
for funding or displaying to users).

## Import

```ts
import { predictMultiOwnerLightAccountAddress } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
```

## Parameters

### params

`PredictMultiOwnerLightAccountAddressParams`
Object containing:
– `factoryAddress` Factory contract that will deploy the account.
– `salt` Arbitrary salt used when calling the factory.
– `ownerAddresses` Array of owner EOAs (must be deduped & sorted).

## Returns

`Address`
Predicted account address for the multi-owner light account.
