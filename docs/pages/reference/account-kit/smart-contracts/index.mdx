The `@account-kit/smart-contracts` package contains all of the definitions for our smart contracts.
This package is designed for developers who want to use our smart contracts, but may want to use their own Signer or Infrastructre for sending user operations.

For a fully integrated stack, consider using the `@account-kit/core` or `@account-kit/react` packages.
