```ts
function predictMultiOwnerLightAccountAddress(params): `0x${string}`;
```

Defined in: account-kit/smart-contracts/dist/types/src/light-account/accounts/predictAddress.d.ts:35

Predicts the address of a **Multi-Owner Light Account** given the factory, salt
and the set of owner addresses.

Internally replicates the CREATE2 calculation performed by the factory so
you can obtain the counter-factual account address before deployment (useful
for funding or displaying to users).
