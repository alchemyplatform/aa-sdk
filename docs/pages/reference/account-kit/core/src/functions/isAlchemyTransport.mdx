```ts
function isAlchemyTransport(transport, chain): transport is AlchemyTransport;
```

Defined in: account-kit/infra/dist/types/alchemyTransport.d.ts:37

A type guard for the transport to determine if it is an Alchemy transport.
Used in cases where we would like to do switching depending on the transport, where there used
to be two clients for an alchemy and a non-alchemy, and with this switch we don't need the two seperate clients. \*
