# toViemAccount

This method lets you adapt your AlchemySigner to a viem LocalAccount, which
will let you use the signer as an EOA directly.

## Import

```ts
import { BaseAlchemySigner } from "@account-kit/signer";
```

## Usage

```ts
import { AlchemyWebSigner } from "@account-kit/signer";

const signer = new AlchemyWebSigner({
  client: {
    connection: {
      rpcUrl: "/api/rpc",
    },
    iframeConfig: {
      iframeContainerId: "alchemy-signer-iframe-container",
    },
  },
});

const account = signer.toViemAccount();
```

## Returns

`LocalAccount`
a LocalAccount object that can be used with viem's wallet client
