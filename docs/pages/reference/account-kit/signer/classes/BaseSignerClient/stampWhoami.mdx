description: Overview of the stampWhoami method
slug: wallets/reference/account-kit/signer/classes/BaseSignerClient/stampWhoami
---

Generates a stamped whoami request for the current user. This request can then be used to call /signer/v1/whoami to get the user information.
This is useful if you want to get the user information in a different context like a server. You can pass the stamped request to the server
and then call our API to get the user information. Using this stamp is the most trusted way to get the user information since a stamp can only
belong to the user who created it.

## Import

```ts
import { BaseSignerClient } from "@account-kit/signer";
```

## Returns

`Promise<TSignedRequest>`
a promise that resolves to the "whoami" information for the logged in user
