# account-kit/infra

The `@account-kit/infra` package contains all of the interfaces and functions that allow you to interact with our ERC-4337 bundler and ERC-7670 compliant Paymaster infrastructure.
This package is designed for developers who want to build their own integrations with our infrastructure, but want to bring their own Signer or Smart Account implementations.

For a fully integrated stack, consider using the `@account-kit/core` or `@account-kit/react` packages.
