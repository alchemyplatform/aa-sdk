```ts
function prepareCalls(client, params): Promise<PrepareCallsResult>;
```

Defined in: [packages/wallet-apis/src/actions/prepareCalls.ts:82](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/v5.x.x/packages/wallet-apis/src/actions/prepareCalls.ts#L82)

Prepares a set of contract calls for execution by building a user operation.
Returns the built user operation and a signature request that needs to be signed
before submitting to sendPreparedCalls.

The client defaults to using EIP-7702 with the signer's address, so you can call
this directly without first calling `requestAccount`.

## Example

```ts
// Prepare a sponsored user operation call (uses signer address via EIP-7702 by default)
const result = await client.prepareCalls({
  calls: [
    {
      to: "0x1234...",
      data: "0xabcdef...",
      value: 0n,
    },
  ],
  capabilities: {
    paymaster: { policyId: "your-policy-id" },
  },
});
```

      </td>

      <td>
        Parameters for preparing calls
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

## Returns

`Promise`\<[`PrepareCallsResult`](../type-aliases/PrepareCallsResult)>

A Promise that resolves to the prepared calls result containing
the user operation data and signature request
