# Alchemy Smart Wallets SDK

Build zero-friction sign-up and transaction flows with smart accounts. Sign up with email, login with passkeys, transact with sponsored gas, and checkout in one click with transaction batching.

Built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh/) and the ERC-4337 standard, this SDK is modular at every layer and can be extended to fit your custom needs.
