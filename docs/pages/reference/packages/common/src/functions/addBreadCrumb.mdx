```ts
function addBreadCrumb(client, breadcrumb): Client<AlchemyTransport>;
```

Defined in: [packages/common/src/actions/addBreadCrumb.ts:20](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/fcb7fb5e0aa11593f6131b1b03318a95d60251de/packages/common/src/actions/addBreadCrumb.ts#L20)

TODO: need to figure out if there's a better way than this...
This adds a tracing breadcrumb to the client during requests.
It returns a basic client without the previously extended actions.
That means you MUST use viem's `getAction` method within actions in case the action is being called from an action that attached a breadcrumb.
That method works by taking a fallback, looking up the action on the client, if it finds it calls it, otherwise it calls the fallback.
