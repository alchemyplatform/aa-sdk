When working with Wallet APIs, you may encounter various errors. Here are some common errors and how to troubleshoot them.

### Replacement underpriced

```json
{
  "code": -32602,
  "message": "replacement underpriced",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  Replacement underpriced errors occur when you attempt to send call from the
  same sender before a pending call has been confirmed on-chain. Please follow
  [these
  recommendations](https://www.alchemy.com/support/how-to-fix-replacement-underpriced-errors).
</Info>

### Execution reverted

```json
{
  "code": -32521,
  "message": "execution reverted",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  This error normally happens if the calls you are attempting to make are
  reverting on-chain. Double check that you are calling the correct method on
  the correct contract address, you are using the correct chain, and that the
  method arguments are correct and properly ABI-encoded.
</Info>

### ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance

```json
{
  "code": -32521,
  "message": "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  If [paying for gas with ERC20
  tokens](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/transactions/pay-gas-with-any-token),
  ensure the sender has the required balance.
</Info>

### AA23 reverted

```json
{
  "code": -32500,
  "message": "validation reverted: [reason]: AA23 reverted",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  AA23 errors happen if sender signature validation reverted or ran out of gas
  (OOG). Please follow [these
  recommendations](https://www.alchemy.com/support/how-to-resolve-entrypoint-aaxx-errors).
</Info>

### AA25 invalid account nonce

```json
{
  "code": -32500,
  "message": "validation reverted: [reason]: AA25 invalid account nonce",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  The nonce used is invalid. This usually happens if trying to reuse an old
  nonce. Please follow [these
  recommendations](https://www.alchemy.com/support/how-to-resolve-entrypoint-aaxx-errors).
</Info>

### Policy ID(s) not found

```json
{
  "code": -32600,
  "message": "Sponsorship failed: [invalid_argument] Policy ID(s) not found. Please ensure you're sending requests with the API key associated with the policies' app, that the policies are active, and the network is allowed.",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  Please ensure you're sending requests with the API key associated with the
  policy's app, the policy is active, and the network is allowed. See [gas
  sponsorship
  docs](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/transactions/sponsor-gas) for more
  info.
</Info>

### Invalid account signature

```json
{
  "code": -32507,
  "message": "invalid account signature",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  The call was rejected because it contains an invalid signature from the
  sender. Be sure that you are correctly signing the signature request(s). Refer
  to the [Wallet API
  quickstart](/docs/wallets/smart-wallet-quickstart/api#3-sign-the-userop) for
  more info.
</Info>

### Precheck failed: sender balance

```json
{
  "code": -32000,
  "message": "precheck failed: sender balance and deposit together is ____ but must be at least ____ to pay for this operation",
  ...
}
```

<Info>
  The sender's balance is too low to cover gas fees. This normally happens when
  you mistakenly forget to include your Gas Sponsorship Policy ID. See [gas
  sponsorship
  docs](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/transactions/sponsor-gas) for more
  info.
