# Send USDC (or other ERC-20s)

In this recipe you'll construct an ERC-20 `transfer` call and submit it through a Smart Account Client. The same pattern works for **any** ERC-20 token; just swap the token address and number of decimals.

> Prefer code? Jump straight to the **React** or **Core** tabs below.



## Next steps

- Parameterize the token address/decimals to support any ERC-20.
- Batch multiple transfers in **one** user operation (e.g. payroll or airdrop).
- Combine with [sponsored gas](/wallets/react/sponsor-gas) for a completely gas-less UX.
