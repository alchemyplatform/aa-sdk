Below you will find two versions of a demo social payments and defi application called **ChainMoney**.

Both versions of this application allow you to signup with email, send money to people by username, and earn yield on your balance.

The first version below uses smart wallet react hooks and built-in auth components while the second uses Wallet APIs to do everything on the backend.

Both will have a live URL you can demo it, as well as a github URL to check out the code and try it yourself!

## ChainMoney using AccountKit

This version of the ChainMoney demo app uses our [react hooks](/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react) and built-in auth components.

You can try our hosted demo below or head over to the github repository to see how it works in greater detail.

## ChainMoney using Wallet APIs

This version of the ChainMoney demo app uses our [wallet APIs](/docs/wallets/api-reference/smart-wallets/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-request-account) on the backend.

As opposed to the above example, this application uses [supabase auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) though you can choose to replace this with any auth system of your choice!


In addition, this implementation requires the developer to maintain their own security model through the management of a private key (or alternatively, several private keys) that [controls access to user accounts](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/chain-money-wallet-apis/blob/4b563fbbaebc6558aa65afbd588fb3e6699e6c2b/lib/wallet-service.ts#L123-L134).
