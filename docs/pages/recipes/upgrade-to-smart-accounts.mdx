Smart accounts unlock seamless transaction flows and advanced features like social login, gas sponsorship, batching, multi-owner accounts, and more. You can easily upgrade your existing wallet connection and user authentication to smart wallets.

## Upgrading External Wallets

If you have an app that currently uses an EOA connector, such as Rainbow Kit, for user's wallets, you can add on Smart Wallets by swapping out the EOA connector for social login and our pre-built UI for EOA connection. This will enable you to use React hooks for wallet connection, social login, and sending of transactions.

You can also use our social login with your existing wallet connection but you will need to build a custom UI to route to users between the two.

Either way you can follow our getting started guides loosely for the steps necessary to integrate smart wallets into the tech stack most closely matching yours:

## Upgrading Embedded EOAs

If you have an existing embedded EOA wallet, you can enable gas sponsorship and batching, by upgrading wallets using EIP-7702.
