title: Hyperliquid Transactions Quickstart
description: Step-by-step guide to let users send transactions on hyperliquid.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have an application integrated with Alchemy Wallets, enabling email and social login for user authentication, and the ability to sign and send transactions seamlessly.

<Tip>
  Support on Hyperliquid for programmatic features like gasless and batched
  transactions powered by Account Abstraction is coming soon!

## Getting Started Instructions

## 1. Set Up Web2 Login with an Alchemy Signer

#### Working with React?

Follow this [Quickstart](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/react/quickstart/new-project) guide to set up a new project.

The most important step is getting your API Key (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`) and ensuring your project is configured correctly on your dashboard. Make sure you have Hyperliquid enabled as a network on your app.

  alt="Hyperliquid dashboard support"
/>

Next, navigate to your `page.tsx`, and get the embedded EOA address using [useSigner()](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useSigner). This new embedded EOA, also known as a signer, will be where users assets live and will sign transactions.

```tsx
const signer = useSigner();
```

Note: in order access your embedded EOA created by Alchemy Signer, you need to have finished authentication. To check your authentication status, you can check [useSignerStatus()](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useSignerStatus). For example:

```tsx
...
 if (signerStatus.isConnected && signer) {
        const address = signer.getAddress();
        console.log("Connected signer address:", address);
      }
 ...
```

#### Not Working With React?

That’s okay! We have lower level methods we can leverage here to access your signer!

You can follow this [Quickstart](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/signer/quickstart), to use our '@account-kit/signer' package directly to create and use our wallets.

#### Create a Signer Instance

```tsx
import { AlchemyWebSigner } from "@account-kit/signer";

export const signer = new AlchemyWebSigner({
  client: {
    connection: {
      apiKey: "API_KEY",
    },
    iframeConfig: {
      iframeContainerId: "alchemy-signer-iframe-container",
    },
  },
});
```

#### Authenticate a User

Next, you’ll need to authenticate your user before you can use the signer. In this example, we use email auth, but we support a number of other auth methods. Check out our [guides](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/react/react-hooks) to complete authentication.

```tsx
import { signer } from "./signer";

const result = await signer.authenticate({
  type: "email",
  email: "example@mail.com",
});
...
```

Once you finish authenticating, you can access your signer!

## 2. Create a Custom Chain Config

Extend [viem’s custom chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction#custom-chains) to create a chain definition for Hyperliquid, as it's not a defined chain on viem yet. This is the chain config you’ll be passing into your viem client in step #3.

```tsx
import { defineChain } from "viem";

export const hype = defineChain({
  id: 999,
  name: "Hype",
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: "Hype",
    symbol: "HYPE",
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ["https://hyperliquid-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{API_KEY}"],
      webSocket: ["wss://hyperliquid-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{API_KEY}"],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: { name: "Explorer", url: "https://hyperevmscan.io/" },
  },
});
```

Wrap it in `defineAlchemyChain` to create an alchemy chain to pass into your `config.tsx`

```tsx
import { defineAlchemyChain } from "@account-kit/infra";

const chain = defineAlchemyChain({
    chain: hype,
    rpcBaseUrl: `https://hyperliquid-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY`,
});

...
//config.tsx
export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "API_KEY" }),
    chain: chain,
    ssr: true, // more about ssr: https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/react/ssr
    storage: cookieStorage, // more about persisting state with cookies: https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
    policyId: "policy_id",
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

## 3. Send Transactions

Got your signer/embedded EOA address? Now you are ready to send transactions! Alchemy signer supports signing messages as raw hashes. You can use methods including `signMessage`, `signTypedData`, and `signTransaction`.

```tsx
const signedTx = await signer.signTransaction(txRequest);
```

Then you can use a generic wallet client to send transactions! For example, if you are using viem, then you can use the 'toViemAccount' method which will allow you to use the signer with a [WalletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet#local-accounts-private-key-mnemonic-etc).

```tsx
import { createWalletClient, http, custom, parseEther } from "viem";

export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  transport: http("https://hyperliquid-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{API_KEY}"),
  chain: Hype,
  account: signer.toViemAccount(),
});

const txRequest = await walletClient.prepareTransactionRequest({
  account: acct,
  to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  value: parseEther("0.0001"),
});

// Sign transaction

const txHash = await walletClient.sendRawTransaction({
  serializedTransaction: signedTx,
});
```
