# Authentication Methods

This page demonstrates how to authenticate users across different frameworks using JSDoc imports.

Authentication is a core part of any application. Whether you're building with React or vanilla JavaScript, our SDK provides powerful authentication capabilities.

## React Authentication

For React applications, use the `useAuthenticate` hook which provides a simple interface for handling authentication flows:

// [!jsdoc-mdx @account-kit/react:useAuthenticate]

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pure JS">

## Pure JavaScript Authentication

For vanilla JavaScript or other frameworks, use the base signer client's authenticate method:

// [!jsdoc-mdx @account-kit/signer:authenticate]

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

After authentication, you can:

- Set up smart account clients
- Send transactions
- Manage user sessions
- Implement multi-factor authentication

Choose the approach that best fits your application architecture!
