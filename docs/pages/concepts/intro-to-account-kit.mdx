Smart Wallets is your all-in-one toolkit for building zero-friction sign-up and transaction flows. But what’s **really** happening under the hood?

Smart Wallets abstracts away the complexity of smart accounts, but as a builder it's useful to have a foundational understanding of how it works. This way, you can make informed decisions and unlock the full potential of smart accounts.

Unlike other embedded wallet providers that only solve sign-up and key management, Smart Wallets goes further by streamlining the transaction flow with features like gas sponsorship. How? Through **smart accounts** 🚀 **Let's break it down.**

## Smart accounts: programmable wallets, not EOAs

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1", marginRight: "10px" }}>
    With Smart Wallets, you'll deploy a **smart account** for each user instead
    of an Externally Owned Account (EOA). This smart account will securely store
    the user's assets, such as tokens or NFTs.

#### What is a smart account?

Unlike EOAs, smart accounts are programmable and can include logic. Smart accounts are wallet contracts that can execute custom logic and transactions on behalf of users.

Smart Wallets comes with enterprise-grade, audited smart account implementations. We recommend using [Modular Account v2](/wallets/smart-contracts/modular-account-v2/overview). Learn more and [choose](/wallets/smart-contracts/choosing-a-smart-account) the smart account that best fits your needs or bring your own smart account.

#### Why smart accounts?

Smart accounts unlock powerful features like gas sponsorship and transaction batching enabling you to create seamless transaction experiences (more on this [later](#sponsor-gas)).

Smart accounts provide flexibility, security, and additional functionality over EOAs. Features like social recovery, two-factor authentication, multi-owner support, and ownership transfer become possible with smart accounts.

In Smart Wallets, this concept will manifest as a [Smart Contract Account](/wallets/concepts/smart-contract-account).

## Authentication: web2 login and key management

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1", marginRight: "10px" }}>
    **Authentication** is a service (e.g., Turnkey or Magic) or application (e.g., MetaMask) that manages a private key and signs transactions. The signature is only valid if the authentication method is an owner of the smart account.

</div>
  <div style={{ flex: "0 0 30%" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/wallets/smartaccount-signer.png"
      alt="Alt text"
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
[Using Smart Wallets](/wallets/react/getting-started), you can secure a user's smart account with email, social login, or passkeys, using non-custodial authentication infrastructure. Smart accounts support advanced use cases, such as multiple owners and ownership transfer, offering more utility than EOAs.

With this setup, users can sign-up, log in, and sign transactions using familiar web2 user experiences.

In Smart Wallets, this concept will manifest as a [Smart Account authentication](/wallets/concepts/smart-account-signer).

## Sending transactions

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1", marginRight: "10px" }}>
With Smart Wallets, [sending transactions](/wallets/react/send-user-operations) is as simple as sending "normal" EOA transactions. The system handles the complexity of processing smart account transactions behind the scenes.

</div>
  <div style={{ flex: "0 0 30%" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/wallets/smartaccount-signer-bundler.png"
      alt="Alt text"
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

Smart account transactions are processed and bundled for efficient on-chain execution. The system gathers transactions from multiple smart accounts and processes them efficiently.

A huge benefit of smart accounts is the ability to [batch transactions](/wallets/react/send-user-operations#batch-user-operation) in one operation creating simpler user experiences. For example, you can now approve and swap in one click, rather than signing, waiting, and sending multiple transactions.

In Smart Wallets, this concept will manifest as transaction sending through a [Smart Account Client](/wallets/concepts/smart-account-client).

## Sponsor gas

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1", marginRight: "10px" }}>
With gas sponsorship, your users won't need to worry about having assets in their accounts to pay for gas. Using [Smart Wallets](/wallets/react/sponsor-gas), simply configure a gas sponsorship policy, insert your policy ID into the SDK, and let the Gas Manager API handle the rest.

</div>
  <div style={{ flex: "0 0 30%" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/wallets/smartaccount-signer-bundler-paymaster.png"
      alt="Alt text"
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Conclusion

Smart Wallets makes it easy to build a web2 user experience from sign-up to transaction. It includes everything you need to bring users onchain:

- Non-custodial **authentication** for web2 login
- Secure and flexible **smart accounts** to store assets
- **Gas sponsorship** to sponsor gas
- Reliable and scalable **transaction processing** to send transactions

Smart accounts might seem complex, but Smart Wallets abstracts away the intricacies, allowing you to focus on building great user experiences.
