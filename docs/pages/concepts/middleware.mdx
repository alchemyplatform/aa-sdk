# Middleware

The [Smart Account Client](/concepts/smart-account-client) is extended with a series of middleware. When building user operations for signing and sending, the flow can be pretty involved.
Sending a UO requires you to get the latest nonce for an account, check if the account is deployed to set the `initCode` or `factory` and `factoryData` in the user operation, estimate fees, estimate gas, and then sign the user operation.
If you want to use a paymaster, you need to generate some `dummyPaymasterAndData` to use during gas estimation, and after estimating gas you can request gas sponsorship from your paymaster.
Middleware allows you to avoid having to write the same flows over and over when all you want to do is call a contract with some data or send some ETH to a destination.

## Middleware order

<Tip>
  When using the [React](/react/overview), [Core](/core/overview), or
  [Infra](/infra/overview) packages, the Smart Account Clients are already
  configured to use the appropriate middleware for your needs. If you want to
  sponsor gas, the Smart Account Clients in these packages abstract the relevant
  middleware away from you since all you need is a `policyId` to sponsor gas
  with Alchemy.
</Tip>

As mentioned above, the client can be configured with a series of middleware that always run in the same order:

1. `dummyPaymasterAndData` - Generates a dummy paymaster and data for gas estimation if using a paymaster (default: noop)
2. `feeEstimator` - Estimates the fees for a user operation. If you are using our RPCs, it's important to use the [`alchemyFeeEstimator`](/reference/account-kit/infra/functions/alchemyFeeEstimator) middleware.
3. `gasEstimator` - Estimates the gas limits for a user operation. The default middleware calls the underlying bundler RPC to `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`.
4. `customMiddleware` - Allows you define custom middleware to run before requesting sponsorship if there are any additional steps you need to take before requesting sponsorship. (default: noop)
5. `paymasterAndData` - Requests a gas sponsorship from a paymaster. (default: noop)
6. `userOperationSimulator` - Simulates a user operation to check if it will be successful. (default: noop)
