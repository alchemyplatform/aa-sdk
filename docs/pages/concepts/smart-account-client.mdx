A smart wallet client is the main interface used to interact with smart wallets and take actions like sending transactions, batching transactions, swapping, sponsoring gas, and more.

## How It Works

The [`SmartWalletClient`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/b8dad097dc537985334efe0c1cc2af4e79dc0050/account-kit/wallet-client/src/client/index.ts#L34) is a EIP-1193 compatible extension of `viem`'s [Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/custom#build-your-own-client) which allows you to interact with smart wallets.

## Prerequisites

- [API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- [Smart wallets installed and configured in your project](/wallets/pages/react/setup)
- (Optional) [A gas policyID](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create)

## Implementation

    <Info>
      [Set up your environment](/wallets/react/quickstart/existing-project) and app integration before using the client. React hooks only support Alchemy Signer.

    The [`useSmartAccountClient`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useSmartAccountClient) hook will use the API key and policy ID settings passed to [`createConfig`](/wallets/react/quickstart/ui-customization).
    ```tsx twoslash
    import React from "react";
    import { useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

    const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({});
    ```

    </Info>
    The [`useSmartAccountClient`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useSmartAccountClient) hook will use the API key and policy ID settings passed to [`createConfig`](/wallets/react/quickstart/ui-customization).

    import { useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

    const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({});
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Javascript">
    Use the [`createSmartWalletClient`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/wallet-client/functions/createSmartWalletClient) function to create a smart wallet client. Replace the API key and policy ID with your own. Additionally, replace the signer with the signer generated during [authentication](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/email-otp#step-4-check-authentication-status).

    ```ts title="client.ts"
    import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
    import { alchemy, sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";
    import {
      createSmartWalletClient,
      type SmartWalletClientParams,
    } from "@account-kit/wallet-client";

    const clientParams: SmartWalletClientParams = {
      transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-alchemy-api-key"}),
      chain: sepolia,
      signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner("0x-your-wallet-private-key"),
      policyId: "your-policy-id",
    };

    const clientWithoutAccount = createSmartWalletClient(clientParams);

    const account = await clientWithoutAccount.requestAccount();

    export const client = createSmartWalletClient({
      ...clientParams,
      account: account.address,
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    When using wallet [APIs](/wallets/smart-wallet-quickstart/api), you don't need to define a client. You can start sending request with APIs directly. 
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced

<Accordion title="Change account types">
By default, the Smart Wallet Client will use [ModularAccountV2](/wallets/smart-contracts/modular-account-v2/overview). This is the cheapest and most advanced Smart Account, but you can specify other smart contract account types as needed. Learn more about the different smart accounts [here](/wallets/smart-contracts/choosing-a-smart-account).

**React and React Native**

- `type` (string) - Defines the smart account type. Options:
  - `"ModularAccountV2"` (recommended and default)
  - `"LightAccount"`
  - `"MultiOwnerLightAccount"`

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({
  type: "LightAccount",
});
```

**Javascript**
We expose interfaces for the various supported smart accounts. This is the easiest way to switch accounts while using Alchemy infra.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createModularAccountAlchemyClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

const alchemyAccountClient = await createModularAccountAlchemyClient({
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
  chain: sepolia,
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
});
```

<Tip>
  Note: Changing the account type will deploy a different account. If you've
  already deployed an account for a user and want to change the underlying
  account type, you'll need to upgrade it. Learn how to upgrade
  [here](/wallets/smart-contracts/other-accounts/modular-account/upgrading-to-modular-account).
</Tip>

**Using 7702**

To use EIP-7702, pass `"7702"`" to the `mode` in `accountParams`. This will delegate the connected EOA to a smart account. Read more [here](/wallets/transactions/using-eip-7702).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Smart account client actions">
Because the Smart Wallet Clients are extensions of viem's clients, they support extensions via the `.extend` method. The base client already includes a [number of actions](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/v4.x.x/aa-sdk/core/src/actions/smartAccount) by default. You can find additional details about these actions in the [`@aa-sdk/core` documentation](/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Account agnostic client">
Typically, the smart account client uses the default account or the account passed into the client constructor for all of the actions you perform with the client - also known as **account hositing**.

If you want to manage multiple instances of an account but want to use one client for all of them, you can pass an account to the client on every action.

```ts
import {
  createAlchemySmartAccountClient,
  sepolia,
  alchemy,
} from "@account-kit/infra";
import { createLightAccount } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { http } from "viem";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

// with account hoisting
const transport = alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });
const hoistedClient = createAlchemySmartAccountClient({
  transport,
  chain: sepolia,
  account: await createLightAccount({
    signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
    chain: sepolia,
    transport,
  }),
});

const signature = await hoistedClient.signMessage({ message: "Hello world! " });

// without account hoisting
const nonHoistedClient = createAlchemySmartAccountClient({
  transport,
  chain: sepolia,
});

const lightAccount = await createLightAccount({
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
  chain: sepolia,
  transport,
});

const signature2 = await nonHoistedClient.signMessage({
  message: "Hello world! ",
  account: lightAccount,
});
```

</Accordion>
