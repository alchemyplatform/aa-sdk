## What Are Session Keys?

Session Keys allow you to add secondary signers to a Modular Account V2 smart wallet with scoped permissions. This unlocks capabilities like:

- letting a dapp take actions on a user's behalf,
- creating time-limited or spend-limited automations,
- and reducing user friction without compromising security.

## Why Use Session Keys?

Session Keys enable you to add additional signers to your smart account with specific permissions. This unlocks features like automated actions a dapp can perform on a user’s behalf, improved security by enabling partial owners on an account, and more!

### Skip duplicate confirmations

Let users interact with your app without repeatedly confirming every action. Once a session key is granted, the app can perform follow-up operations — fast and frictionless.

Session keys unlock a simplified authentication process by allowing users to interact with apps without needing to confirm each action using their primary key. Instead, users create a session key with permissions specific to the app, then the app can use that key for future actions. This speeds up the user interaction and provides a smoother experience.

### Automate actions

Allow smart wallets to handle recurring interactions like token approvals, claim flows, or contract calls — without user prompts.

With the ability to delegate specific permissions to session keys, users can automate actions within predefined limits. Session keys can be used to streamline processes like recurring payments, contract interactions, or any activity that benefits from automation.

### Securely delegate access

Session keys reduce exposure of the main private key by creating temporary or restricted alternatives. Even if compromised, session keys can’t take over the account.

By delegating authorization to a separate key, the exposure of the main private key is minimized. Even if a session key is compromised, the attacker would not gain access to the user’s main account and funds. This layered approach to security helps in mitigating risks associated with key management.

### Apply permissions for safety

Session keys are only powerful when scoped properly. Modular Account V2 includes a growing library of permissions, and also supports custom modules for your own access logic.

To ensure that session keys are not able to take over an account, permissions have to be applied on them to scope the keys such that they can only perform certain actions. Modular Account V2 comes with several permissions you could use today, and if any other custom permission is required, you could build a hook module that provides this to plug into Modular Account V2.
