## What Permissions Can You Apply to Session Keys?

Session keys work best when they are tightly scoped. Modular Account V2 gives you a flexible set of built-in permission types.

Use these to limit what a key can do, for how long, where it can call, and how much it can spend.

### Time Range

Supports limiting keys with a start and/or expiry time ranges

### ERC-20 Spending Limits

Supports limiting how much of a specific ERC-20 token a key may spend

### **Gas and native token spending limits**

Supports limiting how much native tokens, e.g. ETH on mainnet, a key may spend

### Access Control Lists

Supports limiting function selectors and/or external contracts that a key may interact with.

### Internal Selector Allowlist

Supports limiting what functions a key may call on the Modular Account (e.g. installing or uninstalling modules, or upgrading the account)

> You can combine multiple permissions on a single session key. These can be layered to match the minimum required access for your use case.

## Composing Permissions: Fine-Grained Control

Permissions are composable. You can apply multiple permissions to a single session key to tightly define its behavior.

Example: You could create a session key that:

- Only works between June 1–June 15
- Can call just one staking contract
- Spend no more than 100 USDC

Use Case: In Alchemy's modular wallet demos, one key is scoped to auto-stake a user's funds once a day, but only within a capped budget and only on a verified contract.

By combining permissions, you can build tailored, safe delegation schemes — perfect for dapps, relayers, and complex workflows.
