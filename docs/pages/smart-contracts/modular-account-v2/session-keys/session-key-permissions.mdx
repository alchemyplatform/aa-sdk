## What Permissions Can You Apply to Session Keys?

Session keys only work if they're restricted — and Modular Account V2 gives you a flexible set of built-in permission types to scope them safely.

Use these to limit what a key can do, for how long, where it can call, and how much it can spend.

### Time Range

Supports limiting keys with a start and/or expiry time ranges

### ERC-20 Spending Limits

Supports limiting how much of a specific ERC-20 token a key may spend

### **Gas and native token spending limits**

Supports limiting how much native tokens, e.g. ETH on mainnet, a key may spend

### Access Control Lists

Supports limiting function selectors and/or external contracts that a key may interact with.

### Internal Selector Allowlist

Supports limiting what functions a key may call on the Modular Account (e.g. installing or uninstalling modules, or upgrading the account)

> You can combine multiple permissions on a single session key. These can be layered to match the minimum required access for your use case.
