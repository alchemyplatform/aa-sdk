## **0. Construct your clients**

First we need to check what kind of account address you have! The way `client.account.address` is derived depends on the type of account and the salt. We'll have to handle different cases depending on whether your client's
address is a light account address or a modular account address. So we construct two clients:

Our **Light Account** client:

```ts
import { createLightAccountClient } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
const lightAccountClient = await createLightAccountClient({
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
    chain: sepolia,
    signer: yourSigner
```

Our **Modular Account** client:

```ts
import { createModularAccountV2Client } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
const modularAccountV2Client = await createModularAccountV2Client({
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
  chain: sepolia,
  signer: yourSigner,
});
```

## **1. Check the implementation of your account (using `client.account.getImplementationAddress()`):**

- **LightAccount** deployment addresses [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account/tree/v2.0.0/deployments)
- **ModularAccount** deployment addresses [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/modular-account/tree/develop/deployments)

Depending on the result, take different actions based on the state of the account.

For your **Modular Account** client:

```ts
import { client } from "docs/shared/infra/client";
const impl = await client.account.getImplementationAddress();

// implementation slot exists and is a deployed modular account. this user has a modular account at the modular account counterfactual address. no work needs to be done.
if (impl == "ModularAccountImpl") {
  // done
}
```

For your **Light Account** client:

```ts
import { client } from "docs/shared/infra/client";
const impl = await client.account.getImplementationAddress();

// implementation slot exists and is a deployed modular account. this user has a modular account at the light account address. no need to upgrade.
if (impl == "ModularAccountImpl") {
  // done
}

// implementation slot exists and is a deployed light account. this user has a light account at the light account address. we need to initiate an upgrade for the user.
else if (impl == "LightAccountImpl") {
  // go to step A
}

// implementation slot is empty
else if (impl == NullAddress) {
  // account is not deployed and has assets at the counterfactual
  const balance = await client.getBalance({ address: client.account.address });
  if (balance) {
    // go to step A
  }
  // account does not exist, new user!
  else {
    // go to step B
  }
}
```

## **2. Upgrade Account!**

### **Case A: Implementation Slot Exists and is a LightAccount**

If the implementation slot exists and points to **LightAccount**, it means the account is a legacy **LightAccount.** Follow this path if the account has been deployed or if the account hasn’t been deployed but has assets at the counterfactual.

Steps:

1. Retrieve the upgrade data `upgradeToData` and method `createMAV2Account` to create the MAv2 account using `getMAV2UpgradeToData` .
2. Call `upgradeAccount` to prepare the upgrade data for MAv2 with the initializer set to give it the same owner as the LA.
3. Call `createSmartAccountClient` to create the MAv2 client from your newly upgraded account

```ts
const { createMAV2Account, ...upgradeToData } = await getMAV2UpgradeToData(
  lightAccountclient,
  { account: lightAccountClient.account }
);

await lightAccountClient.upgradeAccount({
  upgradeTo: upgradeToData,
  waitForTx: true,
});

const maV2Client = createSmartAccountClient({
  client: createBundlerClient({
    chain: yourchain,
    transport: yourTransport,
  }),
  account: await createMAV2Account(),
});
```

### **Case B: Implementation Slot is Empty (No Account or Account Not Deployed With No Assets)**

If the implementation slot is empty, this means that the account doesn’t exist. Or, if the account exists but has no assets, we still want to follow this path.

- Construct a **MAv2** client with the signer to handle both cases:

1. **New user with no account**.
2. **New user with an existing but un-deployed account**.

```ts twoslash modular-account-v2.ts
import { createModularAccountV2Client } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

const maV2Client = await createModularAccountV2Client({
  mode: "default", // optional param to specify the MAv2 variant (either "default" or "7702")
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }), // Get your API key at https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps or http("RPC_URL") for non-alchemy infra
  signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
});
```

This ensures that operations are executed on the already upgraded **MAv2** account.

---

### **3. Send a User Operation!**

Send a user operation to deploy your upgraded account!

```tsx
const result = await maV2Client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: target,
    value: sendAmount,
    data: "0x",
  },
});
```

And now you’ve upgraded your account to MAV2!

You can use a [Modular Account v2 client](/wallets/smart-contracts/modular-account-v2/getting-started#creating-a-modular-account-v2-client) to send user operations or use the [React packages](/wallets/react/how-to-set-up-smart-account-client#usage) directly to simplify integration - this hook defaults to MAv2. **Make sure to pass in an `accountAddress` param to the client to connect the client to the existing account.**
