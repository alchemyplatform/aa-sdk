# Smart Contracts Overview

One of the low level packages available in Account Kit is our Smart Contracts package. This package contains all of the smart contract interfaces and utilities you need to use any of our
secure, audited smart contracts.

In these guides, we'll show you how to pick and choose the right smart contract for you and how to use them in your application.

:::tip
For the easiest integration, we recommend using [`@account-kit/react`](/react/overview) or [`@account-kit/core`](/core/overview) which support all of the contracts in this package by default.
