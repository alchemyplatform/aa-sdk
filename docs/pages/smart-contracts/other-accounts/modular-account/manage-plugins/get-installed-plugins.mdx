# How to get the installed plugins of a Modular Account

[ERC-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) Modular Accounts implements Plugin inspection interface [`IAccountLoupe.sol`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900#iaccountloupesol) to support visibility in plugin configuration on-chain. This contract interface defines the method `getInstalledPlugins()` that clients can use to fetch the currently installed plugins on a Modular Account.

```solidity
/// @notice Get an array of all installed plugins.
/// @return The addresses of all installed plugins.
function getInstalledPlugins() external view returns (address[] memory);
```

Account Kit provides a streamlined experience of interacting with Modular Account AccoutLoupe interface easily by providing `accountLoupeActions` defined in `@account-kit/smart-contracts` package. When you connect your Modular Account to `SmartAccountClient` you can extend the client with `accountLoupeActions`, which exposes a set of methods available to call the account `AccountLoupe` with the client connected to the account.

## Get installed plugins of a Modular Account

You should first extend the `SmartAcountClient` connected to a Modular Account, which has `AccountLoupe` implemented, with `accountLoupeActions` for the client to include the `AccountLoupe` actions.

Then, you can use the `getInstalledPlugins` method of the `accountLoupeActions` extended smart account client to get the list of installed plugin addresses for the connected Modular Account.

:::tip[Note]
When using `createModularAccountAlchemyClient` in `@account-kit/smart-contracts`, the `SmartAccountClient` comes automatically extended with `multiOwnerPluginActions`, `pluginManagerActions`, and `accountLoupeActions` decorators as defaults available for use.

```ts example.ts twoslash
import { modularAccountClient } from "./client";
import { IPluginAbi } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";

// returns addresses of all installed plugins
const installedPlugins = await modularAccountClient.getInstalledPlugins({});

if (installedPlugins.length === 0) {
  console.log("account has no plugins installed.");
  return;
}

const pluginAddress = installedPlugins[0];
// read plugin metadata of a plugin
const metadata = await modularAccountClient.readContract({
  address: pluginAddress,
  abi: IPluginAbi,
  functionName: "pluginMetadata",
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2));
// {
//   name: 'MultiOwnerPlugin',
//   version: '1.0.0',
// }
```

```ts client.ts twoslash filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/smart-contracts/modular-account-client.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>

By checking if a certain plugin address exists in the list of installed plugin addresses of a Modular Account, you can check whether a particular plugin is installed or not on a Modular Account.
