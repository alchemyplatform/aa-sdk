## Overview

The Multisig plugin adds `k of n` threshold signature scheme to your Modular Account, similar to [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/) accounts. This is a powerful security layer that is recommended for accounts that require additional security and redundancy beyond a single signer.

The `n` signers can be any combination of ECDSA or SCA signers. A threshold of `k` signatures will be required to execute any user operation on the smart account.

## Secure, audited, open source

The Multisig Plugin has been audited by Quantstamp. You can find the audit reports [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/multisig-plugin/blob/develop/audits).

It is also fully open source so you can validate the [source code](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/multisig-plugin).

Now, let's [get started](getting-started) with the multisig plugin!
