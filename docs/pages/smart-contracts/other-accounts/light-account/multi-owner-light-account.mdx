A `MultiOwnerLightAccount` has one or more ECDSA or SCA owners. This lets your account integrate with multiple signers at once, and supports recovering your account if one signer is lost.

The `MultiOwnerLightAccount` is able to:

- Update (add or remove) owners for an account.
- Show all owners of an account.
- Validate signed signatures of ERC-4337 enabled user operations as well as regular transactions.

When you connect your `MultiOwnerLightAccount` to `SmartAccountClient` you can extend the client with `multiOwnerLightAccountClientActions`, which exposes a set of methods available to call the `MultiOwnerLightAccount` with the client connected to the account.

<Note>
  When using `createMultiOwnerLightAccountAlchemyClient` in
  `@account-kit/smart-contracts`, the `SmartAccountClient` comes automatically
  extended with `multiOwnerLightAccountClientActions` as defaults available for
  use.
</Note>

### 1. Get all current owners of a `MultiOwnerLightAccount`

You can use the `getOwnerAddresses` method on the `MultiOwnerLightAccount` object, which can be accessed from a connected client.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts [example.ts] twoslash
import { multiOwnerLightAccountClient } from "./client";

const owners = await multiOwnerLightAccountClient.account.getOwnerAddresses();
```

</CodeBlocks>

### 2. Add or remove owners for a `MultiOwnerLightAccount`

You can use the `updateOwners` method on the `multiOwnerLightAccountClientActions` extended smart account client to add or remove owners from the `MultiOwnerLightAccount`.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts [example.ts] twoslash
import { multiOwnerLightAccountClient } from "./client";

const ownersToAdd = []; // the addresses of owners to be added
const ownersToRemove = []; // the addresses of owners to be removed

const opHash = await multiOwnerLightAccountClient.updateOwners({
  ownersToAdd,
  ownersToRemove,
});

const txHash =
  await multiOwnerLightAccountClient.waitForUserOperationTransaction({
    hash: opHash,
  });
```
