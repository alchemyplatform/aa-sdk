### 1. Request an Account for the Owner Signer

Given an owner address, call `wallet_requestAccount` to return the smart account address for that owner. The [owner](/docs/wallets/concepts/smart-account-signer) address can be any signer (or public key) that has the ability to sign transactions.

- If you want to use social sign up / log in, you can simply use the [SDK](/docs/wallets/react/getting-started) to authenticate users and retrieve their signer address
- If instead, you want to generate and control wallets with a custodied owner, you can generate any public private key pair (e.g. any EOA)

This will return the account address associated with the given signer, as well as a uuid you could use to differentiate between accounts for the same signer in the future.

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_requestAccount",
    "params": [
        {
            "signerAddress": "0xOWNER_ADDRESS"
        }
    ]
}
'
```

This will return the smart account address associated with the given signer:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "accountAddress": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
    "id": "af638-a8..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Create a Session With the Session Key Signer

<Accordion title="Using EIP-7702?">

If you are using an EIP-7702 account, the account must be delegated onchain
before creating the session. If the account has already sent calls, it will
already be delegated. If it hasn't sent any calls before creating the session
key, you can delegate it by sending an empty call as the owner.

[Follow the instructions here](/docs/reference/wallet-apis-7702-quickstart#using-the-json-rpc-apis-directly)
to send your first call. Note that the `calls` in the request to `wallet_prepareCalls` can be an empty array
if you do not want to send any calls.

</Accordion>

To create a session key using onchain policies:

- Get the public address of a key you want to use as a session key. This can be any key pair that has the ability to sign (aka a [signer](/docs/wallets/concepts/smart-account-signer) that is either an local [signer](/docs/wallets/reference/aa-sdk/core/classes/LocalAccountSigner/constructor#localaccountsigner) like an EOA or signer generated with a signer provider).
- Create a session for that key, by passing it as the `publicKey` in a call to `wallet_createSession`. (Note that this must be the public key **address**, not the full public key.)

Note that the expiry is in seconds and represents a UNIX timestamp (e.g. 1776657600 for April 20th, 2077).

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "wallet_createSession",
    "params": [
        {
            "account": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
            "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID",
            "expirySec": UNIX_TIMESTAMP_EXPIRY_IN_SECONDS,
            "key": {
                "publicKey": "0xSESSION_KEY_ADDRESS",
                "type": "secp256k1",
            },
            "permissions": [
                {
                    "type": "root"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

This will return two key elements:

1. The session ID
2. The signature request that must be signed by the account owner to authorize the session key

Keep note of the session ID, you'll need it later!

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": {
        "sessionId": "0xSESSION_ID",
        "signatureRequest": {
            "type": "eth_signTypedData_v4",
            "data": {...},
            "rawPayload": "0xRAW_PAYLOAD_TO_SIGN"
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Sign the Session Key Authorization

Sign the signature request using the account owner's key (used in step 1), then store the resulting signature. If you are using an Alchemy Signer, you can directly sign the `rawPayload`. If you are using a library that supports signing typed data, you can use it to sign the typed data.

### 4. Prepare Calls With the Session Key

With the session ID received in step 2 and the signature from step 3, we're now ready to prepare some calls!

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_prepareCalls",
    "params": [
        {
            "capabilities": {
                "paymasterService": {
                    "policyId": "GAS-MANAGER-POLICY-ID", // put your gas manager policy ID here
                },
                "permissions": {
                    "sessionId": "0xSESSION_ID",
                    "signature": "0xPERMISSION_SIG",
                }
            },
            "calls": [
                {
                    "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
                }
            ],
            "from": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
            "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID"
        }
    ]
}
'
```

This will return the userop request (the `data` field) and a signature request, for example:

```json
{
    "type": "user-operation-v070",
    "data": {...useropRequest},
    "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID",
    "signatureRequest": {
        "type": "personal_sign",
        "data": {
            "raw": "0x_HASH_TO_SIGN",
        },
        "rawPayload": "0xRAW_PAYLOAD_TO_SIGN"
    }
}
```

### 5. Sign the userop

With the returned signature request, all you have to do is sign the userop hash returned in the `signatureRequest` field. This should be signed with the session key. This signature will be valid as long as it is within the permissions the session key has.

Note that the `type` field in the `signatureRequest` indicates the signature type needed. In this case, we need to `personal_sign` the hash, or, if using an Alchemy Signer, you can directly sign the `rawPayload` instead.

### 6. Send the Prepared Calls!

With the signature from step 5 and the `useropRequest` from step 4, you're good to go to send the call!

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_sendPreparedCalls",
    "params": [
        {
            "type": "user-operation-v070",
            "data": {...useropRequest},
            "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID", // e.g. "0x66eee" for Arbitrum Sepolia
            "capabilities": {
                "permissions": {
                    "sessionId": "0xSESSION_ID",
                    "signature": "0xPERMISSION_SIG",
                }
            },
            "signature": {
                "type": "secp256k1",
                "data": "0xUSEROP_SIGNATURE",
            }
        }
    ]
}
'
```

This will return the array of prepared call IDs!
