## Using The TypeScript SDK

### 1. Install Prerequisites

You're going to need the `@account-kit/wallet-client` and `@account-kit/infra`. We'll also be using `LocalAccountSigner` from `@aa-sdk/core` as the signer for demonstration purposes.

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
```

```shell bun
bun add @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
```

```shell yarn
yarn add @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm install @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Create A Smart Wallet Client

Create a client for a given signer (e.g. a `LocalAccountSigner` imported from `@aa-sdk/core` or an [Alchemy Signer](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/signer/what-is-a-signer#alchemy-signer)).

```ts
import { createSmartWalletClient } from "@account-kit/wallet-client";
import { alchemy, arbitrumSepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";

const signer = LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(PRIVATE_KEY); // we use a private key signer as an example here

const transport = alchemy({
  apiKey: ALCHEMY_API_KEY, // use your Alchemy app api key here
});

const client = createSmartWalletClient({
  transport,
  chain: arbitrumSepolia, // use any chain imported from @account-kit/infra here
  signer,
});
```

### 3. Create the session key

<Accordion title="Using EIP-7702?">

If you are using an EIP-7702 account, the account must be delegated onchain
before creating the session. If the account has already sent calls, it will
already be delegated. If it hasn't sent any calls before creating the session
key, you can delegate it by sending an empty call as the owner:

```ts
const preparedCalls = await client.prepareCalls({
  calls: [], // empty array since you don't want to send any calls
  from: account.address,
  capabilities: {
    paymasterService: {
      policyId: GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID, // put your gas manager policy ID here
    },
  },
});

const signedCalls = await client.signPreparedCalls(preparedCalls);

const { preparedCallIds } = await client.sendPreparedCalls(signedCalls);

const status = await client.getCallsStatus(preparedCallIds[0]);
```

Now you can continue to create the session key as described below.

</Accordion>

```ts
const account = await client.requestAccount(); // Request an account for the owner signer

// This is where you would use your session key signer!
const sessionKey = LocalAccountSigner.generatePrivateKeySigner();

const permissions = await client.grantPermissions({
  account: account.address,
  expirySec: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 60,
  key: {
    publicKey: await sessionKey.getAddress(),
    type: "secp256k1",
  },
  permissions: [{ type: "root" }], // Here we grant root permissions as an example, but this is not advised in production!
});
```

### 4. Send calls using the session key

```ts
import { signPreparedCalls } from "@account-kit/wallet-client";

const preparedCalls = await client.prepareCalls({
  calls: [{ to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", value: "0x0" }],
  from: account.address,
  capabilities: {
    paymasterService: {
      policyId: GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID, // put your gas manager policy ID here
    },
    permissions,
  },
});

const signedCalls = await signPreparedCalls(
  sessionKey, // Note that we now sign with the session key!
  preparedCalls,
);

const { preparedCallIds } = await client.sendPreparedCalls({
  ...signedCalls,
  capabilities: {
    permissions,
  },
});

// Check calls status.
const status = await client.getCallsStatus(preparedCallIds[0]);
```
