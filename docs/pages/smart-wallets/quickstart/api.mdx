## Using The JSON-RPC APIs Directly

### 1. Request an Account for the Owner Signer

Given an owner address, call `wallet_requestAccount` to return the smart account address for that owner. The [owner](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/concepts/smart-account-signer) address can be any signer (or public key) that has the ability to sign transactions.

- If you want to use social sign up / log in, you can simply use the [SDK](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/getting-started) to authenticate user's and retrieve their signer address
- If instead, you want to generate and control wallets with a custodied owner, you can generate any public private key pair (e.g. any EOA)

This will return the account address associated with the given signer, as well as a uuid you could use to differentiate between accounts for the same signer in the future.

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_requestAccount",
    "params": [
        {
            "signerAddress": "0xOWNER_ADDRESS"
        }
    ]
}
'
```

This will return the smart account address associated with the given signer:

```bash
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": {
    "accountAddress": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
    "id": "af638-a8..."
}
```

### 2. Prepare Calls

Now that we have an account, it's time to prepare some calls!

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_prepareCalls",
    "params": [
        {
            "capabilities": {
                "paymasterService": {
                    "policyId": GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID // put your gas manager policy ID here
                }
            },
            "calls": [
                {
                    "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
                }
            ],
            "from": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
            "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID"
        }
    ]
}
'
```

This will return the userop request (the `data` field) and a signature request, for example:

```bash
type: "user-operation-v070",
data: {...useropRequest},
chainId: "0xCHAIN_ID"
signatureRequest: {
    type: "personal_sign",
    data: {
    raw: HASH_TO_SIGN,
    }
}
```

### 3. Sign the userop

With the returned signature request, all you have to do is sign the userop hash returned in the `signatureRequest.data.raw` field from step 4.

You'll sign this using the account owner (from step 1). If using Alchemy Signer, you can learn how to stamp the request on the frontend [here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/how-to-stamp-requests).

Note that the `type` field in the `signatureRequest` indicates the signature type needed, in this case, we need to `personal_sign` the hash.

### 4. Send the Prepared Calls!

With the signature from step 3 and the `useropRequest` from step 2, you're good to send the call!

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_sendPreparedCalls",
    "params": [
        {
            "type": "user-operation-v070",
            "data": {...useropRequest},
            "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID", // E.g. "0x66eee" for Arbitrum Sepolia
            "signature": {
                "type": "secp256k1"
                "data": "0xUSEROP_SIGNATURE"
            }
        }
    ]
}
'
```

This will return the array of prepared call IDs!

### 5. Check The Calls Status

Now you can simply call `wallet_getCallsStatus` to check the status of the calls.

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_getCallsStatus",
    "params": [
        "0xPREPARED_CALL_ID"
    ]
}
'
```

See [here](/docs/node/smart-wallets/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-get-calls-status) for all of the possible results.
