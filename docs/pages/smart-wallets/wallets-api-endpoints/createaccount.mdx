Programmatically create a new wallet. A new Ethereum and Solana private key will be generated inside our non-custodial key management infrastructure. The wallet is secured by the user’s authentication credentials.

**Using React or Vanilla JS?** Use our [Account Kit SDK](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/) to create and use wallets. The SDK handles all signing and authentication complexity for you, making development faster and easier. We provide an [SDK](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk) in React, Vanilla Typescript, and (soon) Java.

If you want to use APIs directly, please first see [this guide](/reference/how-to-stamp-requests) for implementing custom logic to send stamped requests.
