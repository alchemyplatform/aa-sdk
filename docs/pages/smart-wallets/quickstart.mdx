This guide outlines exactly what you need to use Wallet Server with your app! We’ll go over the [`wallet_requestAccount`](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/smart-wallets/wallets-api-endpoints/wallets-api-endpoints/wallet-request-account), [`wallet_createSession`](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/smart-wallets/wallets-api-endpoints/wallets-api-endpoints/wallet-create-session), [`wallet_prepareCalls`](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/smart-wallets/wallets-api-endpoints/wallets-api-endpoints/wallet-prepare-calls), and [`wallet_sendPreparedCalls`](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/smart-wallets/wallets-api-endpoints/wallets-api-endpoints/wallet-send-prepared-calls) endpoints in this tutorial.

The logical flow is to get an account for a given signer, create a session for use with that account, prepare the calls you’re looking to send, and send them! If you're looking for a typescript SDK guide, you'll find that here too.

Session keys are useful if you are looking to grant your app’s server partial, secure access to user’s wallets so that the server can sign and send transactions on a user’s behalf within certain permissions.

In API calls, it’s as simple as:

```mermaid

  A[Request Account] -.-> C[Create Session]
  A --> D[Prepare Calls]
  C -.-> D
  D --> E[Send Prepared Calls]

  %% styling the optional step
  classDef optional stroke-dasharray:5;
  class C optional;
```

If instead, you don’t want to use session keys and you want the user to sign all of the transactions, you can simply skip the createSession step and use the client side signer to sign prepared calls.

This guide assumes you have an account you can sign with, like an [Alchemy Signer](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/signer/what-is-a-signer#alchemy-signer). You will also need an Alchemy API key and a [gas manager policy ID.](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/react/sponsor-gas)

</Tip>

## Using The Account Kit SDK

### Install Prerequisities

You're going to need `@account-kit/wallet-client`, `@account-kit/infra`, optionally `@aa-sdk/core` if you use a `LocalAccountSigner`, and optionally `viem` if you want to verify a signed message.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
  ```

  ```shell bun
  bun add @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add @account-kit/wallet-client @account-kit/infra @aa-sdk/core
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create A Smart Account Client

Given a signer (e.g. a `LocalAccountSigner` imported from `@aa-sdk/core` or an [Alchemy Signer](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/signer/what-is-a-signer#alchemy-signer)), all you need to do is follow a few simple steps to start sending user ops with Wallet APIs!

```ts
import { createSmartWalletClient } from "@account-kit/wallet-client";
import { alchemy, arbitrumSepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";

const signer = LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(PRIVATE_KEY); // we use a private key signer as an example here

const transport = alchemy({
  apiKey: ALCHEMY_API_KEY, // use your Alchemy app api key here!
});

const client = createSmartWalletClient({
  transport,
  chain: arbitrumSepolia, // use any chain imported from @account-kit/infra here!
  mode: "remote",
  signer,
});
```

### Request The Account

A counterfactual address is the account address associated with the given signer-- but the account contract hasn't been deployed yet.

```ts
const account = await client.requestAccount();
  
// get the address
const address = account.address;
```

### Sign A Message

```ts
import { createPublicClient } from "viem";

const message = "we are so back"
  
const signature = await client.signMessage({ message });
  
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: arbitrumSepolia,
  transport: transport,
});
  
const isValid = await publicClient.verifyMessage({
  address: account.address, // fetched from await client.requestAccount()
  message,
  signature,
});
```

### Sign Typed Data

```ts
// assuming you have a typedData variable
const signature = await client.signTypedData({typedData});
  
const isValid = await publicClient.verifyTypedData({
  address: account.address, // fetched from await client.requestAccount()
  ...typedData,
  signature,  
});
```

### Send A UserOp

```ts
import { zeroAddress } from "viem";

const account = await client.requestAccount();
  
const preparedCalls = await client.prepareCalls({
  calls: [{ to: zeroAddress, value: "0x0" }], // callData is optional in a "data" parameter
  from: account.address,
  // "capabilities" is a data structure that hold gas manager data (as seen below) or permission data
  capabilities: {
    paymasterService: {
      policyId: GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID, // put your gas manager policy ID here
    },
  },
});
  
// Sign the calls
const signedCalls = await client.signPreparedCalls(preparedCalls);
  
// Send the userOp
const result = await client.sendPreparedCalls(signedCalls);
```

### Create A Session With Permissions

Session keys allow another account to operate on a user's smart account with given permissions. See [here for a list of permissions!](#permission-types)

```ts
const account = await client.requestAccount();
  
// This is where you would use your session key signer!
const sessionKey = LocalAccountSigner.generatePrivateKeySigner();
  
const permissions = await client.grantPermissions({
  account: account.address,
  expirySec: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 60,
  key: {
    publicKey: await sessionKey.getAddress(),
    type: "secp256k1",
  },
  permissions: [{ type: "root" }], // Here we grant root permissions as an example, but this is not advised in production!
});
  
const preparedCalls = await client.prepareCalls({
  calls: [{ to: zeroAddress, value: "0x0" }],
  from: account.address,
  capabilities: {
    paymasterService: {
      policyId: GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID, // put your gas manager policy ID here
    },
    permissions,
  },
});
  
const signedCalls = await signPreparedCalls(
  sessionKey, // Note that we now sign with the session key!
  preparedCalls,
);
  
const result = await client.sendPreparedCalls({
  ...signedCalls,
  capabilities: {
    permissions,
  },
});
```

## Using The JSON-RPC APIs Directly

### 1. Request an Account for the Owner Signer

Given an owner address, call `wallet_requestAccount` to return the smart account address for that owner. The [owner](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/concepts/smart-account-signer) address can be any signer (or public key) that has the ability to sign transactions.

* If you want to use social sign up / log in, you can simply use the [SDK](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/getting-started) to authenticate user’s and retrieve their signer address
* If instead, you want to generate and control wallets with a custodied owner, you can generate any public private key pair (e.g. any EOA)

This will return the account address associated with the given signer, as well as a uuid you could use to differentiate between accounts for the same signer in the future.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "wallet_requestAccount",
  "params": [
    {
      "signerAddress": "0xOWNER_ADDRESS"
    }
  ]
}
'
```

This will return the smart account address associated with the given signer:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "accountAddress": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
    "id": "af638-a8..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Create a Session With the Session Key Signer

Session keys are useful if you are looking to define on-chain policies or grant your app’s server partial, secure access to user’s wallets so that the server can sign and send transactions on a user’s behalf within certain permissions. If you don’t want to use session keys for server side signing, you can skip to step 4.

After creating a session, you will be able to sign transactions for the generated wallet within the defined permissioned using that session key.

To create a session key using onchain policies:

* Get the public address of a key you want to use as a session key. This can be any key pair that has the ability to sign (aka a [signer](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/concepts/smart-account-signer) that is either an local [signer](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/reference/aa-sdk/core/classes/LocalAccountSigner/constructor#localaccountsigner) like an EOA or signer generated with a signer provider)
* Create a session for that key using your session key public address - here passed in `publicKey` call `wallet_createSession`.

Note that the expiry is in seconds and represents a UNIX timestamp. (E.g. 1776657600 for April 20th, 2077)

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "wallet_createSession",
  "params": [
    {
      "account": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
      "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID",
      "expirySec": UNIX_TIMESTAMP_EXPIRY_IN_SECONDS,
      "key": {
        "publicKey": "0xSESSION_KEY_ADDRESS",
        "type": "secp256k1"
      },
      "permissions": [
        {
          "type": "root"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

This will return two key elements:

1. The session ID
2. The signature request you’ve got to sign to authorize the session key

Keep note of the session ID, you’ll need it later!

```bash
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": {
        "sessionId": "0xSESSION_ID",
        "signatureRequest": {
            "type": "eth_signTypedData_v4",
            "data": {...userOperation}
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Sign the Session Key Authorization

Sign the signature request from the owner key (used in step 1), then store the resulting signature.

### 4. Prepare Calls With the Session Key

With the session ID received in step 2 and the signature from step 3, we’re now ready to prepare some calls!

If you aren't using a session key, you can omit the "permissions" parameter in the capabilities object.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "wallet_prepareCalls",
  "params": [
    {
      "capabilities": {
        "paymasterService": {
            "policyId": GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID, // put your gas manager policy ID here
        },
        "permissions": {
          "sessionId": 0xSESSION_ID,
          "signature": 0xPERMISSION_SIG,
        }
      },
      "calls": [
        {
          "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        }
      ],
      "from": "0xACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
      "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID"
    }
  ]
}
'
```

This will return the userop request (the `data` field) and a signature request, for example:

```bash
type: "user-operation-v070",
data: {...useropRequest},
chainId: "0xCHAIN_ID"
signatureRequest: {
  type: "personal_sign",
  data: {
    raw: HASH_TO_SIGN,
  }
}
```

### 5. Sign the userop

With the returned signature request, all you have to do is sign the userop hash returned in the `signatureRequest.data.raw` field from step 4.

* If not using session keys, you’ll sign this with the owner of the account (from step 1). You can learn how to stamp the request on the frontend [here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/how-to-stamp-requests).
* If using session keys, you can sign this with the session key that was added in step 2 and 3. This signature will be valid as long as it is within the permissions the session key has.

Note that the `type` field in the `signatureRequest` indicates the signature type needed, in this case, we need to `personal_sign` the hash.

### 6. Send the Prepared Calls!

With the signature from step 5 and the `useropRequest` from step 4, you’re good to go to send the call!

If you are signing with the owner of the account and not a session key, you can omit the entire capabilities object.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "wallet_sendPreparedCalls",
  "params": [
    {
      "type": "user-operation-v070",
      "data": {...useropRequest},
      "chainId": "0xCHAIN_ID" // E.g. "0x66eee" for Arbitrum Sepolia
      "capabilities": {
        "permissions": {
          "sessionId": 0xSESSION_ID,
          "signature": 0xPERMISSION_SIG,
        }
      }
      "signature": {
        "type": "secp256k1"
        "data": "0xUSEROP_SIGNATURE",
      }
    }
  ]
}
'
```

This will return the array of prepared call IDs!

## Permission Types

To set specific permissions on a session key installation, add an object to the permissions array when calling `client.grantPermission()` via the SDK or when calling `wallet_createSession` via APIs directly.

```ts
const permissions = await client.grantPermissions({
  account: account.address,
  expirySec: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 60,
  key: {
    publicKey: await sessionKey.getAddress(),
    type: "secp256k1",
  },
  permissions: [{PERMISSION_ONE}, {PERMISSION_TWO}],
});
  
```

### Native Token Transfer

This permission allows transfer of native tokens (like Ether) from the account.

```ts
{
  type: "native-token-transfer";
  data: {
    allowance: Hex; // a hexadecimal encoded transfer limit, for example, 1 ETH would be 0xde0b6b3a7640000 (1e18 in hex)
  };
}
```

### ERC20 Token Transfer

This permission allows transfer or approval of erc20 tokens from the account. Both transfers and approvals count towards the limit.

```ts
{
  type: "erc20-token-transfer";
  data: {
    address: Address; // erc20 token contract address
    allowance: Hex;   // a hexadecimal encoded transfer limit
  };
}
```

### Gas Limit

This permission allows the session key to spend gas for user operations up to a specified limit.

```ts
{
  type: "gas-limit";
  data: {
    limit: Hex; // a hexadecimal encoded gas limit, for example 300000 gas would be 0x493e0
  };
}
```

### Contract Access

This permission grants access to **all** functions in a specific contract.

```ts
{
  type: "contract-access";
  data: {
    address: Address; // the target contract’s address
  };
}
```

### Account Functions

This permission grants access to specific functions on the smart account itself.

```ts
{
  type: "account-functions";
  data: {
    functions: Hex[]; // array of allowed function selectors, e.g. ["0xabcdef01", "0x12345678"]
  };
}
```

### Functions On All Contracts

This permission grants access to a set of function selectors **across any** address.

```ts
{
  type: "functions-on-all-contracts";
  data: {
    functions: Hex[]; // array of function selectors allowed globally, e.g. ["0xddf252ad"]
  };
}
```

### Functions On Contract

This permission grants access to specific function selectors on **one** contract.

```ts
{
  type: "functions-on-contract";
  data: {
    address: Address;  // the contract address you’re targeting
    functions: Hex[];  // array of allowed function selectors for that contract, e.g. ["0xddf252ad"]
  };
}
```

### Root

This permission grants full access to everything. Needless to say, this is a very dangerous permission to grant.

```ts
{
  type: "root"; // no additional data required
}
```
