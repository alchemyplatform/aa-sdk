In this step you will get your authentication working so users can login with their smart wallets.

## Setup your application

First, configure your application and your API Key:

1. Create an app in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup) and copy the **API Key**.

2. Create a **`configuration`** in the [`Smart Wallets` dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) to enable login methods.

Hold onto your API Key for the next step.

## Setup the Alchemy Accounts Provider

Now set up and configure the Alchemy Accounts Provider in your project.

You can do this by wrapping the top level component (e.g. `_layout.tsx` in Expo or `App.tsx` in Bare React Native) in your app with the `AlchemyAccountsProvider` component from the `@account-kit/react-native` package.

Here's an example of how to do this:

<CodeBlocks>

<Markdown src="../../../shared/react-native/account-provider-setup.mdx" />

</CodeBlocks>

## Choose your authentication

Now that you have set up the Alchemy Accounts Provider, you can setup your authentication!

You can choose from many authentication guides with react native instructions, like [this one on Email One-Time Passwords](/docs/wallets/authentication/login-methods/email-otp#react-native).

## Next Steps

Once you have authentication working, you can explore additional features:
