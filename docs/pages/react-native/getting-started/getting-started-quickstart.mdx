slug: wallets/react-native/getting-started/getting-started-quickstart
---

## Project Setup

Simply run:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart
```

This will create a new Expo project with Smart Wallets setup. Next you will setup your API key and accounts configuration.

1. Create an app in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup) and copy the **API Key**.

2. Create a **`configuration`** in the [`Smart Wallets` dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) to enable login methods.

Follow the repository's [latest README instructions](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart/blob/main/README.md) on how to set your API key and run the application.

And you're off to the races!
