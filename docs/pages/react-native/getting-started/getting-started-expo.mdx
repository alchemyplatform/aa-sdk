We would go through the steps to get your environment setup for using Smart Wallets within a React Native application on Expo.

<Markdown src="../../../shared/react-native/prerequisites.mdx" />

## Create a new Expo project

If you don't have an Expo project setup, you can create one using the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

## Upgrade to the latest version of Expo

The first thing we need to do is make sure we're on the latest version of Expo (SDK 52 or later). The reason for this is that we need React Native version 0.76 or higher because it has `TextEncoder` natively supported.

For more information on upgrading an Expo project, check out the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/).

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npx
npx expo install expo@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn expo install expo@latest
```

</CodeBlocks>

<Info>
You can also use our [quickstart template](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart) to get started quickly.
Simply run

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart
```

</Info>

Then you want to upgrade all dependencies to match the new Expo SDK version.

```bash
npx expo install --fix
```

## Set up shims

Once we've got our Expo project setup and running, we need to setup a few shims so we can use crypto libraries in React Native.

### Install shim dependencies

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install --save node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

```bash yarn
yarn add node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

</CodeBlocks>

### Register shim modules in Metro

Create or edit your `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project so that it includes the following:

```js metro.config.js
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const path = require("path");
const projectRoot = __dirname; // <-- Adjust this as fits your project setup

// Add aliases for file-system import based modules
const ALIASES = {
  "@noble/hashes/crypto": path.resolve(
    projectRoot,
    "node_modules/@noble/hashes/crypto.js"
  ),
  "@sinclair/typebox": path.resolve(
    projectRoot,
    "node_modules/@sinclair/typebox/build/cjs/index.js"
  ),
};

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(projectRoot);
// [!code focus:9]
// The following code ensures we have the necessary
// shims for crypto built into our project
config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,
  ...require("node-libs-react-native"),
  crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
  stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
};

config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (ALIASES[moduleName]) {
    return {
      filePath: ALIASES[moduleName],
      type: "sourceFile",
    };
  }
  return context.resolveRequest(context, moduleName, platform);
};

// The `account-kit/react-native` and it's supoorting packages leverages package.json `exports` which is not (yet) suported by default in Metro.
// we can enable this support using:
config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = true;
config.resolver.unstable_conditionNames = [
  "browser",
  "require",
  "react-native",
];

module.exports = config;
```

### Register global shims

Import the following packages at the topmost entry point of your app so that libraries that depend on globals like `crypto` have access to them.

If you are using `expo-router`, add the imports in your topmost `_layout.tsx` file in the `app` directory. However if you are using a different navigation library (e.g. `react-navigation`),
add the imports in your topmost `App.tsx` file.

```tsx App.tsx or app/_layout.tsx
import "node-libs-react-native/globals.js";
import "react-native-get-random-values";

// rest of App.tsx
```

## Install Smart Wallets

That's it! Now you can install the packages you want from Smart Wallets and start building your React Native Account Abstraction app.

<Warning>
If you get an error about mismatched peer dependencies for React, you can use `--legacy-peer-deps` in your install commands to avoid this error.

The `@account-kit/react-native` package is an ESM module. As such, have to add the following to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions`:

```json
"module": "NodeNext",
"moduleResolution": "nodenext",
```

</Warning>

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install --save @account-kit/react-native @account-kit/smart-contracts @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @account-kit/react-native @account-kit/smart-contracts @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react-native-signer
```

</CodeBlocks>

### Add supporting dependencies

To ensure the Signer package works correctly, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install --save react-native-mmkv zustand abitype react-native-inappbrowser-reborn viem wagmi @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash yarn
yarn add react-native-mmkv zustand abitype react-native-inappbrowser-reborn viem wagmi @tanstack/react-query
```

</CodeBlocks>

<Warning>
The zustand library uses `import.meta` which is not supported in the latest version of Expo. To fix this, create a `babel.config.js` file with the following content:

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [["babel-preset-expo", { unstable_transformImportMeta: true }]],
  };
};
```

</Warning>

## Set iOS minimum deployment target

Since we require a minimum deployment target of iOS 17, you will need to instruct Expo to set this during pre-build. First, install `expo-build-properties` via:

```bash
npx expo install expo-build-properties
```

Then add the plugin to your `app.json`:

```json
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "17.0"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Run a Prebuild!

Now that we've got everything setup, we can run a prebuild to ensure the native modules are properly built and added to your project.

<CodeBlocks>

```bash android
npx expo prebuild --platform android
```

```bash ios
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Run the app

Because the app is using native modules, you cannot run it with expo go and instead need to use development builds. You can do this with the `android` and `ios` commands:

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm(android)
npm run android
```

```bash yarn(android)
yarn android
```

```bash npm(ios)
npm run ios
```

```bash yarn(ios)
yarn ios
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Common Issues

### NotSupportedError: Cannot set "location"., js engine: hermes

If you get this error, you can add the following to you `app.json` within the `expo` config:

```json
"extra": {
  "router": {
    "origin": false
  }
}
```

### Build error: androidx.browser:browser requires a higher Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version or compileSdk version

If you get this error when running the Android app, you can fix this by updating the `android/build.gradle` to include the following override:

```gradle
allprojects {
  configurations.all {
      resolutionStrategy {
          // Force a specific version of androidx.browser
          force 'androidx.browser:browser:1.8.0'
      }
  }
}
```

### `npm install` fails due to mismatching peer dependencies

Our packages list a minimum version of React as 18.2.0, but the latest version of expo is on >=19. If you are using `npm install` it's likely you'll get errors about peer dependencies. To force a consistent version of react, you can add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
"overrides": {
  "react": "19.0.0",
  "react-dom": "19.0.0"
}
```
