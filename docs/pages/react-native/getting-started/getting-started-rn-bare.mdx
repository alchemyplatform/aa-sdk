title: Getting started with Account Kit on bare React Native

<Info>
  This guide assumes you already have a Bare React Native app and want to
  integrate Account Kit. If you are starting a project from scratch, we
  recommend following the [Expo
  guide](/wallets/react-native/getting-started/getting-started-expo) instead.
</Info>

We would go through the steps to get your environment setup for using Account Kit within a Bare React Native application.

<Snippet />

## Set up shims

Once we've got our React Native project setup and running, we need to setup a few shims so we can use crypto libraries in React Native.

### Install shim dependencies

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install --save node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

```bash yarn
yarn add node-libs-react-native crypto-browserify stream-browserify react-native-get-random-values
```

</CodeBlocks>

### Register shim modules in Metro

Create or edit your `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project so that it includes the following:

```js metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig } = require("@react-native/metro-config");
const path = require("path");
const projectRoot = __dirname;
const config = getDefaultConfig(projectRoot);

// Add aliases for file-system import based modules
const ALIASES = {
  "@noble/hashes/crypto": path.resolve(
    projectRoot, // <-- Adjust this as fits your project setup
    "node_modules/@noble/hashes/crypto.js",
  ),
};

config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,
  ...require("node-libs-react-native"),
  crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
  stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
};

config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (ALIASES[moduleName]) {
    return {
      filePath: ALIASES[moduleName],
      type: "sourceFile",
    };
  }
  return context.resolveRequest(context, moduleName, platform);
};

// Important to allow importing package exports
config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = true;

config.resolver.unstable_conditionNames = [
  "browser",
  "require",
  "react-native",
];

module.exports = config;
```

### Register global shims

Import the following packages at the top of your `index.js` file so that libraries that depend on globals like `crypto` have access to them.

```js index.js
import "node-libs-react-native/globals.js";
import "react-native-get-random-values";

// rest of index.js
```

## Install Account Kit and build!

That's it! Now you can install the packages you want from Account Kit and start building your React Native Account Abstraction app.

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install -s @account-kit/react-native @account-kit/smart-contracts @account-kit/infra
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @account-kit/react-native @account-kit/smart-contracts @account-kit/infra
```

</CodeBlocks>

<Tip>
The `@account-kit/react-native` package is an ESM module. As such, you might have to add the following to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions`:

```json
"module": "NodeNext",
"moduleResolution": "nodenext",
```

</Tip>

### Add supporting dependencies

To ensure the Signer package works correctly, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install react-native-mmkv zustand abitype react-native-inappbrowser-reborn
```

```bash yarn
yarn add react-native-mmkv zustand abitype react-native-inappbrowser-reborn
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Build and run your project

Now that we've got everything setup, we can build our project!

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
