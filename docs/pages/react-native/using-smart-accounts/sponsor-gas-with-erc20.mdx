Gas fees paid in the native network token can feel foreign to users that mainly hold stablecoins or your app's own token. With **Account Kit** you can let them pay those fees in any ERC-20 token approved in your **Gas Manager** policy.

## Goal

Allow your React Native app to sponsor gas fees with a chosen ERC-20 token (for example **USDC**) so users don't need native ETH.

## Prerequisites

- Account Kit set up in your project.
- An Alchemy API key.
- A Gas Manager policy of type "Pay gas with any token". (_TODO â€“ link to policy creation guide_)
- The ERC-20 token contract address you want to accept.

## Steps

### 1 Add the policy to your global config

```ts twoslash config.ts
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/react-native";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
  chain: sepolia,
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID", // your policy
  policyToken: {
    address: "0x", // USDC_ADDRESS or an ERC-20 token address
    maxTokenAmount: 10_000n, // optional safety limit
  },
});
```

All hooks will now pay gas with the token configured above.

### 2 Send a sponsored UserOperation

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { View, Pressable, Text } from "react-native";
import { useSendUserOperation } from "@account-kit/react-native";

export default function PayWithTokenButton() {
  const { sendUserOperation } = useSendUserOperation();

  return (
    <View>
      <Pressable
        onPress={() =>
          sendUserOperation({
            uo: {
              target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
              data: "0x",
              value: 0n,
            },
          })
        }
      >
        <View>
          <Text>Send token-sponsored UO</Text>
        </View>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### 3 (Optional) Override on a single client

Create a dedicated client if you only want certain operations to use the policy.

```tsx twoslash
const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
  policyToken: {
    address: "0x", // USDC_ADDRESS or an ERC-20 token address
    maxTokenAmount: 10_000n,
  },
});
```

Use this `client` with any hook that sends UserOperations.

## Done

Your app now sponsors gas with the specified ERC-20 token!
