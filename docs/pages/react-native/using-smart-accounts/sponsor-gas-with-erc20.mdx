title: Pay gas with ERC-20 tokens
description: Enable your users to pay gas with ERC-20 tokens like USDC via Gas Manager

Gas fees paid in the native network token can feel foreign to users that mainly hold stablecoins or your app's own token. With **Account Kit** you can let them pay those fees in any ERC-20 token approved in your **Gas Manager** policy.

## Create a Gas Manager policy

_TODO_

## Set the Policy ID and token globally

Attach an ERC-20 policy to every `UserOperation` sent by the hooks by passing both `policyId` **and** `policyToken` when you create your Account Kit config.

<Tip>
  Replace `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, `GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID`, and `USDC_ADDRESS` with
  your own values.
</Tip>

```ts twoslash config.ts
// @noErrors
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/react-native";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
  chain: sepolia,
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID", // [!code ++]
  policyToken: {
    // [!code ++]
    address: "USDC_ADDRESS", // ERC-20 used to pay gas
    // Optional: limit max token amount the paymaster can pull
    maxTokenAmount: 10_000n,
  },
});
```

All `UserOperations` dispatched with the [Send User Operations](/wallets/react-native/using-smart-accounts/send-user-operations) guide will now be paid with the token you provided.

## Set the policy per UserOperation

If you want finer control, pass the same two fields to `useSmartAccountClient()`.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { View, Pressable, Text } from "react-native";
import {
  useSmartAccountClient,
  useSendUserOperation,
} from "@account-kit/react-native";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({
    policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    policyToken: {
      address: "USDC_ADDRESS", // [!code ++]
    },
  });
  const { sendUserOperation } = useSendUserOperation({ client });

  return (
    <View>
      <Pressable
        onPress={() =>
          sendUserOperation({
            uo: {
              target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
              data: "0x",
              value: 0n,
            },
          })
        }
      >
        <View>
          <Text>Send USDC-Sponsored User Operation</Text>
        </View>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Things to keep in mind

• The account must hold enough of the chosen token to cover the gas cost.
• If your policy uses the **After** transfer mode (default), the first sponsored operation must include or be preceded by an `approve` so the paymaster can pull tokens. The helper shown in `useSendUOsErc20Sponsorship` in the repo can automate this for you.
• The USD value of the tokens transferred is added to your monthly Alchemy invoice, just like native-token sponsorship.
