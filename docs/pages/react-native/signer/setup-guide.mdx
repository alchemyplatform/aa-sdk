# React Native Signer setup guide

Setting up the React Native Signer is similar to setting up the [React Signer](/wallets/signer/quickstart) with a few extra steps.

<Snippet />

## Dashboard Setup

1.  Get your **API key** by creating a new app in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)

        <Warning>

    Make sure **Ethereum** is enabled for your app under the Networks tab

    </Warning>

2.  Create a **new account config** in your [Account Kit Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)

        <br />
        a. Apply the config to your app from step 1
        <img
          src="/images/account-kit/getting-started/apply-config-to-app.png"
          alt="apply your the config to the app from the first step"
          style={{ width: "50%" }}
        />
        <br />
        b. Enable authentication methods you want to support.

        <br />
        <u>**Email auth (OTP)**</u>
        <br />
        If you're using OTP Auth, toggle on email fill in the required fields. For **Redirect
        URL**, you can just pass in the URL of your website (it doesn't get used during
        OTP flows).
        <br />

        <Tip>

    If you're only using OTP auth, you can skip to step 3!

    </Tip>

        <u>**Email auth (Magic Link)**</u>

        - To use email auth in your React Native app, your app needs to be set
          up to handle deep links that can be served via http or https.

        - In production
          scenarios, you would want to set up [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)
          on android or [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app)
          on iOS to gracefully handle deep links.

        - For testing, simply setting up a simple
          server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) or any other server
          you control which redirects an incoming request to your app scheme is the easiest
          way to get started. a sample implementation of this can be found the [`example`](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/examples/react-native-expo-example/redirect-server/index.ts)
          folder of the `React Native Signer` repo.

        - The http or https url you set up
          in the previous step would need to be added as the **Redirect URL** in the Account
          Kit Dashboard.

        - This is the url that the user will be redirected to if you use
          the magic link email flow to log in your users.

        - Optionally stylize ✨ the email
          with your brand color and logo!

        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/account-kit/getting-started/email-auth-setup.png"
          alt="configure email auth"
          style={{ width: "50%" }}
        />
        <br />

        <u>**Social auth**</u>

        If you want to enable social login, toggle which auth providers
        you want to support.

        - Make sure to add your app's deep link as a **whitelisted origin**. This is necessary to handle redirects from the signer after a user has been authenticated.
        - Add the link that your dapp will be running on to the **whitelisted origin** list
        - Optionally enter your own OAuth credentials or use our defaults

        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/account-kit/getting-started/social-auth-setup-mobile.png"
          alt="configure social auth"
          style={{ width: "50%" }}
        />

3.  Create the config and copy the **API Key**

## Ensure Deep Linking is properly configured

<Tip>
  If you're using OTP Auth, skip this step! We recommend starting with OTP flows
  as they are easier to set up.
</Tip>

If you plan on using email magic link auth or social auth, you'll need to ensure deep linking is properly configured in your app.

Depending on if your app uses `expo-router`, `react-navigation`, or some other navigation library, you'll need to configure deep linking accordingly.

Here are some useful links for some common navigation libraries:

- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/into-your-app/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/)
