# Setting up the Alchemy Accounts Provider

<Markdown src="../../../../shared/react-native/setup-guides-snippet.mdx" />

Once you have followed the [Signer Setup Guide](/wallets/react-native/signer/setup-guide), set up and configure the Alchemy Accounts Provider in your project.

You can do this by wrapping the top level component (e.g. `_layout.tsx` in Expo or `App.tsx` in Bare React Native) in your app with the `AlchemyAccountsProvider` component from the `@account-kit/react-native` package.

Here's an example of how to do this:

<CodeBlocks>

```tsx [_layout.tsx (Expo)] twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/react-native/account-provider-setup.tsx]
```

```tsx [App.tsx (Bare React Native)] twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/react-native/account-provider-setup.tsx]
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Next Steps

Now that you have set up the Alchemy Accounts Provider, you can follow the [Authentication Guides](/wallets/react-native/signer/authenticating-users/authenticating-with-otp) to learn how to authenticate users.
