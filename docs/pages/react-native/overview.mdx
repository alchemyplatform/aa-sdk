# Using within React Native applications

We've built a simple example for reference purposes [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-expo-example). This was built using Expo, but the same principles should apply to a bare React Native app as well.

## Getting Started

### Get up and running quickly using our Quickstart Template

You can quickly spin up a new React Native (Expo) project setup with Account kit by using our [quickstart template](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart).

Simply run:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart
```

This will create a new Expo project with Account Kit setup and ready to go! You can then follow the instructions to setup a [Signer in your project](/wallets/react-native/signer/setup-guide).

### Adding Account Kit to a new or existing React Native project?

<Info>
  If you are starting a fresh project, we highly recommend using Expo. You can
  easily create a new Expo project by running `npx create-expo-app@latest` from
  your terminal. Visit the [Expo
  docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) for more
  information.

Whether you're using Expo or a bare React Native app, follow our guides to get started with using Account Kit in your project.
