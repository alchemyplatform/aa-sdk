We've built a simple example for reference purposes [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native-expo-example). This was built using Expo, but the same principles should apply to a bare React Native app as well.

## Getting Started

### Get up and running quickly using our Quickstart Template

You can quickly spin up a new React Native (Expo) project setup with Account kit by using our [quickstart template](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/account-kit-expo-quickstart). Follow along with this guide:

### Adding Smart Wallets to a new or existing React Native project?

<Info>
  If you are starting a fresh project, we highly recommend using Expo. You can
  easily create a new Expo project by running `npx create-expo-app@latest` from
  your terminal. Visit the [Expo
  docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) for more
  information.

Whether you're using Expo or a bare React Native app, follow our guides to get started with using Smart Wallets in your project.
