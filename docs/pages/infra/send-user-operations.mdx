# Send User Operations

Once you've completed the [Quickstart](/infra/quickstart), you're ready to start sending user operations!

User operations can be sent either as single user operations or as a batch of user operations. In this guide, we'll cover both methods.

## Single User Operation

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { client } from "./client";

const { hash } = await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});
```

```ts twoslash client.ts filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/infra/client.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Batch User Operations

To batch user operations, you can just pass an array of user operations to the `sendUserOperation` method.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { client } from "./client";

const { hash } = await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: [
    {
      target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
      data: "0x",
      value: 0n,
    },
    {
      target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS_2",
      data: "0x",
      value: 0n,
    },
  ],
});
```

```ts twoslash client.ts filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/infra/client.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>
