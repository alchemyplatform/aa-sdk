The `@account-kit/infra` package provides client and middleware defintions for interacting with our ERC-4337 infrastructure. It makes it really easy to use just our infra (gas manager and bundler RPC) if you'd like more control over which smart contracts or signer you're using. The guides in this section of the
site will help you get started with interacting with our infrastructure directly. If you're using this package directly you will need to make a decision on:

1. which smart contracts to use as accounts (see [Choosing a smart account](#TODO)).
2. which signer to use as an owner on the accounts (see [Choosing a signer](#TODO)).
