In the [Quickstart](/wallets/infra/quickstart), we covered an example that sends a user operation with gas sponsorship using our Gas Manager. In this guide, we'll recap how to sponsor gas using the Gas Manager, and also show you
how to use other paymaster providers as well.

## Sponsor Gas with Gas Manager

### 1. Create gas policy

<Markdown src="../../shared/create-gas-policy.mdx" />

### 2. Create a Smart Account Client

Now you can create a Smart Account Client which is configured to sponsor gas.

<Markdown src="../../shared/infra/client.mdx" />

### 3. Send a user operation with gas sponsorship

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { client } from "./client";

const { hash } = await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});
```

<Markdown src="../../shared/infra/client.mdx" />

</CodeBlocks>

## Sponsor Gas with 3rd-party paymaster

If you're using a 3rd party paymaster to sponsor gas, but our Bundler RPC endpoints, the set up is a bit more involved, but easily doable.

### Prerequisite: install aa-sdk/core

Because the Smart Account Client exported from `@account-kit/infra` assumes you're using our infra for both gas sponsorship and bundler RPCs, you'll need to install `@aa-sdk/core`
so you can create more configurable clients.

<CodeBlocks>

```bash yarn
yarn add @aa-sdk/core
```

```bash npm
npm i -s @aa-sdk/core
```

</CodeBlocks>

### ERC-7677 compliant paymasters

If your paymaster is [ERC-7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677) compliant, we export a paymaster middleware that makes it really easy to integrate with that paymaster.

```ts twoslash
import {
  createSmartAccountClient,
  erc7677Middleware,
  split,
} from "@aa-sdk/core";
import {
  sepolia,
  alchemyFeeEstimator,
  createAlchemyPublicRpcClient,
  alchemy,
} from "@account-kit/infra";
import { createLightAccount } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
// You can replace this with any signer you'd like
// We're using a LocalAccountSigner to generate a local key to sign with
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { http, custom } from "viem";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

// 1. create an alchemy rpc client
const alchemyTransport = alchemy({
  apiKey: "API_KEY",
});

const alchemyRpcClient = createAlchemyPublicRpcClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: alchemyTransport,
});

// 2. create a split transport to route traffic between the paymaster and the bundler
const transport = split({
  overrides: [
    {
      methods: ["pm_getPaymasterStubData", "pm_getPaymasterData"],
      transport: http("PAYMASTER_URL"),
    },
  ],
  fallback: alchemyTransport,
});

// 3. create smart account client
export const client = createSmartAccountClient({
  transport,
  chain: sepolia,
  account: await createLightAccount({
    chain: sepolia,
    transport: alchemyTransport,
    signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
  }),
  // this is required to get correct fee estimates when using our Bundler RPC
  feeEstimator: alchemyFeeEstimator(alchemyRpcClient),
  ...erc7677Middleware(),
});
```
