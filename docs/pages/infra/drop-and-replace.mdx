```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { client } from "./client";

// 1. send a user operation
const { hash, request } = await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});

try {
  // 2. wait for it to be mined
  const txHash = await client.waitForUserOperationTransaction({ hash });
} catch (e) {
  // 3. if it fails, resubmit the user operation via drop and replace
  const { hash: newHash } = await client.dropAndReplaceUserOperation({
    uoToDrop: request,
  });

  // 4. wait for the new user operation to be mined
  await client.waitForUserOperationTransaction({ hash: newHash });
}
```

In the above example, we only try to drop and replace once before failing completely, but you can build more complex retry logic using this combination of `waitForUserOperationTransaction` and `dropAndReplace`.
