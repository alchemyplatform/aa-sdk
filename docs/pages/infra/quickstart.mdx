# Infra Quickstart

Account Kit is composed of some lower-level libraries if you're looking for further customization of your stack or want more control over how you build your application.
One of these libraries is `@account-kit/infra` which allows you to interact with our infrastructure directly, while bringing your own smart contracts or signer.
In this guide, we'll cover how to get started with `@account-kit/infra` and send a user operation. For smart contracts, we'll leverage `@account-kit/smart-contracts` to use `LightAccount`,
but you're free to use any smart contract you'd like.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

- minimum Typescript version of 5
- pin viem to 2.20.0 (`yarn add viem@2.20.0`)

**Installation**

<CodeBlocks>

```bash yarn
yarn add @account-kit/infra @account-kit/smart-contracts
```

```bash npm
npm i -s @account-kit/infra @account-kit/smart-contracts
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Get your Alchemy API Key

<GetApiKeySnippet />

## Create a Gas Manager policy

If you want to sponsor gas, then you'll also want to create a gas policy in the Gas Manager dashboard.

<CreateGasManagerPolicySnippet />

## Create a client

Now that you have an API key and a Policy ID, you can create a [Smart Account Client](/concepts/smart-account-client) to interact with the infrastructure.

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_POLICY_ID` with the key and Policy ID created
  above.
</Warning>

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/shared/infra/client.ts]
```

## Send a user operation

The last step is to send a user operation using the client you just created.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { client } from "./client";

const { hash } = await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});
```

```ts twoslash client.ts filename="client.ts"
// [!include ~/shared/infra/client.ts]
```

</CodeBlocks>
