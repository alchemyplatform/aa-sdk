Everything you need to build zero-friction user flows, from sign-up to checkout, in minutes.

From building with plug-n-play UI components and familiar social logins to enabling one-click transactions with sponsored gas and invisible signing, our docs guide you through it all with step-by-step instructions and ready-to-use code examples.

Build, customize, and scale with embedded wallets powered by smart accounts.
