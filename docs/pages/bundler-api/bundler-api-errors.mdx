This document provides a list of the JSON-RPC errors that you might encounter when using the Bundler API. These are in addition to the [standard JSON-RPC error codes](/reference/error-reference#json-rpc-error-codes) returned by a bad method call.

### `-32500`: Rejected by EntryPointâ€™s `simulateValidation`

* **Description**: The `userOp` is rejected by entryPoint's `simulateValidation`, during account creation or validation. The `-32500` error code may be accompanied by an additional [`AAxx` revert code](/reference/entrypoint-revert-codes) provided by the EntryPoint to give additional guidance.

**Data Fields**:

* `reason`: Optional string providing the main reason for the rejection.
* `inner_reason`: Optional string providing additional details for the rejection.
* `revert_data`: Optional bytes containing additional data related to the rejection.

### `-32501`: Rejected by paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp`

* **Description**: The `userOp` is rejected by paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp`.

**Data Fields**:

* `paymaster`: Address of the paymaster.
* `reason`: String providing the reason for the rejection.

### `-32502`: Opcode violation

* **Description**: The `userOp` does an Opcode violation or tries to access inaccessible storage. Before submitting `userOps`, bundlers must make sure `userOps` don't grief the bundler by accessing banned opcodes when checking a signature.

**Data Fields**:

* `entity`: Type of entity (e.g., paymaster, sender) accessing the storage.

* `opcode`: Opcode that caused the violation.

* Additional fields (when associated with `StakeTooLow`):

  * `needs_stake`: Entity that needs staking.
  * `accessing_entity`: Type of entity accessing the storage.
  * `accessed_address`: Address of the accessed storage.
  * `accessed_entity`: Optional type of accessed entity.
  * `slot`: Storage slot accessed.
  * `minimum_stake`: Minimum required stake.
  * `minimum_unstake_delay`: Minimum required unstake delay.

### `-32503`: Out of time range

* **Description**: Either the account or the paymaster returned a time-range, and it is already expired or will expire soon.

**Data Fields**:

* `valid_until`: Timestamp indicating the valid until time.
* `valid_after`: Timestamp indicating the valid after time.
* `paymaster`: Optional address of the paymaster.

### `-32504`: Throttled or banned

* **Description**: The `userOp` was rejected because the paymaster or aggregator is throttled or banned.

**Data Fields**:

* `entity`: Type of entity (e.g., paymaster, aggregator) that is throttled or banned.
* `address`: Address of the entity.

### `-32505`: Stake or unstake-delay too low

* **Description**: The `userOp` was rejected because the paymaster's or signature aggregator's stake or unstake delay was too low.

**Data Fields**:

* `needs_stake`: Entity that needs staking.
* `accessing_entity`: Type of entity accessing the storage.
* `accessed_address`: Address of the accessed storage.
* `accessed_entity`: Optional type of accessed entity.
* `slot`: Storage slot accessed.
* `minimum_stake`: Minimum required stake.
* `minimum_unstake_delay`: Minimum required unstake delay.

### `-32506`: Unsupported aggregator

* **Description**: The `userOp` was rejected because the wallet specified unsupported signature aggregator.

**Data Fields**:

* `aggregator`: Address of the unsupported aggregator.

### `-32507`: Invalid signature

* **Description**: The `userOp` was rejected because it contains an invalid signature from the sender or the paymaster.

**Data Fields**:

* No additional data fields.

### `-32521`: Execution reverted

* **Description**: The `userOp` was reverted during the execution phase.

**Data Fields**:

* `revert_data`: Optional bytes containing additional data related to the revert.

### `-32602`: Invalid `userOp`

* **Description**: The `userOp` struct/fields sent to the bundler were invalid.

**Data Fields**:

* `current_max_priority_fee`: Optional U256 containing the current maximum priority fee.
* `current_max_fee`: Optional U256 containing the current maximum fee.

### `-32603`: Internal error

Description: Internal JSON-RPC error.

**Data Fields**:

* No additional data fields.
