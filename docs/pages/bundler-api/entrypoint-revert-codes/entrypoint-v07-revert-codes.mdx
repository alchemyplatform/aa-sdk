Bundler JSON-RPC error codes are often accompanied by an additional AAxx code provided by the EntryPoint.

* **AA1x** error codes relate to **creating an account**
* **AA2x** error codes relate to **the sender or the user operation itself** (nonce, signature, prefund, time validity, verification gas)
* **AA3x** error codes relate to **paymasters** (deposit, expiration, verification)
* **AA9x** error codes are **general and not related to a certain theme** (invalid addresses, failed sends, invalid aggregator, etc.)

***

## AA10 sender already constructed

The `sender` (smart account) has already been created. This error may occur if you attempt to create the same account multiple times using `initCode`.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Remove the `initCode` if you're re-submitting a UserOp for an existing account.
2. Ensure the `initCode` is only used for initial account creation.

***

## AA13 initCode failed or OOG

The `initCode` ran out of gas (OOG) or reverted during the account creation process. The smart account was not successfully deployed.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Ensure the account has sufficient native token to pay for deployment if you aren't using a paymaster.
2. Verify the factory address (the first 20 bytes of the `initCode`) is correct.
3. Increase the `verificationGasLimit` to ensure the `initCode` can execute fully.
4. If the `initCode` reverted, investigate the cause (e.g., incorrect factory bytecode, logic errors).

***

## AA14 initCode must return sender

The `initCode` returned a different address than the expected `sender`. The code that handles the creation must return the `sender` address as the newly deployed contract.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Check your factory or account creation logic to ensure it returns the correct address.
2. Verify that the deployed account address matches the address specified in the `UserOperation`.

***

## AA15 initCode must create sender

After executing `initCode`, the `sender` address must have code (the account contract must be deployed). If the `sender` remains a non-contract address (EOA-like), this error is raised.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Ensure that `initCode` actually deploys a contract at the `sender` address.
2. Verify your factory contract logic to ensure a contract is always deployed.

***

## AA21 didn't pay prefund

The `sender` did not have enough deposit to cover the required prefund for the operation (if no paymaster is used).

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Increase the deposit of the `sender` to cover the gas costs (via `depositTo` on the EntryPoint).
2. Use a paymaster to cover the operation costs if funds are insufficient.

***

## AA22 expired or not due

The operation is either expired or not yet valid based on its `validUntil` or `validAfter` time fields.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Check that the current block timestamp is within the valid time range for your UserOp.
2. Ensure you haven’t missed the operation’s validity window and resubmit within its allowed timeframe.

***

## AA23 reverted

The account’s `validateUserOp` call reverted. This could indicate a logical error within the account validation step.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Investigate the revert reason returned by the account contract using tools like Tenderly.
2. Ensure the `validateUserOp` logic in the account contract is correct and doesn’t revert under normal conditions.

***

## AA24 signature error

The `validateUserOp` call or signature verification failed. The signature provided did not pass validation.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Verify that you’re using the correct private key and signature scheme.
2. Check that the aggregator (if used) is correct and that the signature is properly formatted.

***

## AA25 invalid account nonce

The nonce provided by the `sender` in the UserOp is invalid, possibly out of sync with the EntryPoint’s stored nonce.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Fetch the current nonce from the EntryPoint before submitting the UserOp.
2. Ensure the UserOp uses the correct nonce sequence.

***

## AA26 over verificationGasLimit

The account or paymaster validation exceeded the specified `verificationGasLimit`.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Increase `verificationGasLimit` in the UserOp to cover the complexity of `validateUserOp`.
2. Optimize the validation logic to consume less gas.

***

## AA31 paymaster deposit too low

The paymaster did not have enough deposit to cover the prefund of the UserOp.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Increase the paymaster’s stake and deposit into the EntryPoint.
2. Ensure the paymaster deposit is sufficient before submitting a UserOp that relies on it.

***

## AA32 paymaster expired or not due

The paymaster validity window has expired or is not yet active.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Check the paymaster’s time validity parameters.
2. Submit within the valid timeframe specified by the paymaster’s validation logic.

***

## AA33 reverted

`validatePaymasterUserOp` call reverted. This indicates a logic error in the paymaster’s validation code.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Investigate the revert reason using debugging tools.
2. Ensure that the paymaster’s validation logic is correct and doesn’t revert under the given conditions.

***

## AA34 signature error

The paymaster’s signature verification (or other form of authorization) failed.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Check the paymaster’s signature or authorization mechanism.
2. Confirm the correct aggregator or verification method is used if applicable.

***

## AA36 over paymasterVerificationGasLimit

The paymaster’s validation logic exceeded its assigned `paymasterVerificationGasLimit`.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Increase the `paymasterVerificationGasLimit`.
2. Reduce the complexity of `validatePaymasterUserOp` so it fits within the assigned gas limit.

***

## AA90 invalid beneficiary

The `beneficiary` address (the entity that receives the collected fees) is `address(0)` or invalid.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Set a valid `beneficiary` address in the `handleOps` call.
2. Ensure the `beneficiary` parameter is not empty.

***

## AA91 failed send to beneficiary

The EntryPoint failed to transfer the collected fees to the `beneficiary`.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Ensure the `beneficiary` is able to receive ETH.
2. Check if the `beneficiary` address is a contract that reverts on ETH reception.

***

## AA92 internal call only

A function intended only for internal calls within the EntryPoint was called externally. This occurs if `innerHandleOp` is invoked by an address other than the EntryPoint itself.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Do not call `innerHandleOp` directly from outside the EntryPoint.
2. Ensure you are calling the EntryPoint’s main methods (`handleOps`, etc.) rather than internal helper methods.

***

## AA93 invalid paymasterAndData

The `paymasterAndData` field is invalid, too short, or not formatted correctly.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Ensure that `paymasterAndData` includes the paymaster address and any additional data as required by the paymaster.
2. Verify that the `paymasterAndData` length meets the minimum expected size.

***

## AA94 gas values overflow

One or more gas-related fields in the `UserOperation` exceed the maximum allowed value (overflows the 120-bit range the EntryPoint uses internally).

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Ensure that all gas-related parameters (`verificationGasLimit`, `callGasLimit`, `paymasterVerificationGasLimit`, `paymasterPostOpGasLimit`, `preVerificationGas`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`) fit within a 120-bit unsigned integer.
2. Use smaller values for gas parameters to avoid overflow.

***

## AA95 out of gas

The entire operation (or a sub-call) ran out of gas. This is usually due to too low gas limits passed to `handleOps`.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Increase the gas limit provided to the bundler or `handleOps` call.
2. Optimize your code to require less gas.

***

## AA96 invalid aggregator

The aggregator address is invalid. For example, it might be the special `address(1)` marker used internally or not meet aggregator requirements.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Use a proper aggregator address that implements the `IAggregator` interface.
2. Check that you’re not using reserved addresses that are disallowed by the EntryPoint.
