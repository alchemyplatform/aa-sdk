Fee logic for Bundler API ( `eth_sendUserOperation` )

## Fee Logic

To provide its services, Alchemy's Rundler requires fees when using [`eth_sendUserOperation`](/reference/eth-senduseroperation), and these fees differ based on the mainnet or testnet in use. Rundler's requirements for priority fees are expressed via the [`rundler_maxPriorityFeePerGas`](/reference/rundler-maxpriorityfeepergas) endpoint.

Each Bundler API endpoint has an [associated compute unit cost](/reference/compute-unit-costs#gas-manager--bundler-apis).

**The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the fee logic and recommendations for each network type:**

| Network Type | Network Name          | Extra Fee Requirement                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet      | All except Arb chains | Priority fee buffer: 25% Base fee buffer: 27% minimum, 50% recommended |
| Mainnet      | Arbitrum Nitro chains | Priority fee buffer: None Base fee buffer: 27%, 50% recommended        |
| Testnet      | All testnets          | Priority fee buffer: None Base fee buffer: 27%, 50% recommended        |

**Recommended Actions for Calculating `maxFeePerGas`**:

1. **Fetch Current Base Fee**: Use the method [`eth_getBlockByNumber`](/reference/eth-getblockbynumber) with the `'latest'` parameter to get the current `baseFeePerGas`.

2. **Apply Buffer on Base Fee**: To account for potential fee changes, apply a buffer on the current base fee based on the requirements and recommendations in the table shown above. (27% is the minimum for bundler acceptance, but we recommend at least 50%)

3. **Fetch Current Priority Fee with Rundler**: Use the [`rundler_maxPriorityFeePerGas`](/reference/rundler-maxpriorityfeepergas) method to query the current priority fee for the network.

4. **Apply Buffer on Priority Fee**: Once you have the current priority fee using `rundler_maxPriorityFeePerGas`, increase it according to the fee requirement table shown above for any unexpected changes (No buffer for Arbitrum Mainnet and 25% buffer for all other mainnets).

5. **Determine `maxFeePerGas`**: Add the buffered values from steps 2 and 4 together to obtain the `maxFeePerGas` for your user operation.

<Warning>
  The Alchemy bundler requires the simulated gas limit efficiency of both a UO's pre-operation gas and call gas to be greater than or equal to 15%. (Note: the 15% efficiency value is subject to change and we will update docs if it does.)

  **Gas limit efficiency** = gas used / gas limit

  **Pre-operation gas** = `preVerificationGas` + `verificationGasLimit` + `paymasterVerificationGasLimit`

  **Note**: for EP v0.6 `paymasterVerificationGasLimit` == `verificationGasLimit`

  This check is intended to prevent user operations from taking up gas limit space in a bundle, but then not using the gas on-chain. This could prevent other UO's from being bundled that otherwise could have. It is recommended to use the results from the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` endpoint, with slight buffers if desired while keeping above 15% efficiency.
</Warning>

<Info>
  It's recommended to use our [AA SDK](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/) to minimize the complexities of estimating user op gas fees.

## FAQs

### How many compute units will it cost to create a smart contract account?

You can deploy a smart contract account in two ways:

* **Contract deployment by a sending transaction**: You can deploy the smart contract account which is essentially a contract by sending a transaction through [`eth_sendRawTransaction`](/reference/eth-sendrawtransaction) from an EOA. This is same as other contract deployments. In this case, it will cost you 250 CUs which is the cost of calling `eth_sendRawTransaction`.
* **Contract deployment by sending a user operation**: You can deploy the smart contract account by sending a user operation through [`eth_sendUserOperation`](/reference/eth-senduseroperation) with a non-empty `initCode`. In this case it will cost you 1000 CUs which is the cost of calling `eth_sendUserOperation`.

### How do we determine fee values to give your UO the best chance of landing on chain?

* [alchemy\_requestGasAndPaymasterAndData](/reference/alchemy-requestgasandpaymasteranddata) is on opinionated endpoint that tries to set fee values that give your user operations a high chance of landing on-chain. Its likely that we're over-estimating here a bit, but this is intentional in order to land your UOs faster!

* We encourage you to try out different fee percentages and determine what works best for you as a balance between cost and chance/time to mine.

* For [alchemy\_requestGasAndPaymasterAndData](/reference/alchemy-requestgasandpaymasteranddata) we offer the ability to override our fee estimates with the `feeOverride` parameters.

  * We default to increasing baseFee by 50% and priorityFee by 5%.
  * **Note**: The feeOverride parameters don't include preVerificationGas (PVG) . The method will always increase the estimated PVG by 5% to give the UO a better chance to mine if the L1 /L2 fee ratio changes. If you would like to modify this value, its recommended you use [alchemy\_requestPaymasterAndData](/reference/alchemy-requestpaymasteranddata) instead.
