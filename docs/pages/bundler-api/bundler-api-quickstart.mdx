## What is a Bundler?

The bundler enables sending transactions from smart accounts. It processes transactions from smart accounts and submits them to the blockchain. Rundler provides high performance and reliability, it's written in Rust and is [completely open source](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/rundler).

To gain deeper insights into this topic, explore our [blog post on account abstraction](https://www.alchemy.com//blog/account-abstraction).

## What is the Bundler API?

The Bundler APIs are a collection of JSON-RPC endpoints which makes it possible for users to work with transactions.

<Info>
  Please note that using
  [`aa-sdk`](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/getting-started/setup.html) to send
  transactions is the easiest way to access the bundler without directly dealing
  with the raw APIs.

## Bundler API Endpoints

All of the Bundler API endpoints are listed below along with links to their individual pages and brief descriptions.

- ### [`eth_sendUserOperation`](/docs/node/bundler-api/bundler-api-endpoints/eth-send-user-operation)

  Submits a transaction to the bundler. If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a transaction hash that you can use to look up the status of the transaction. If it fails, or another error occurs, an error code and description will be returned.

- ### [`eth_estimateUserOperationGas`](/docs/node/bundler-api/bundler-api-endpoints/eth-estimate-user-operation-gas)

  Estimates the gas values for a transaction. It returns the `preVerificationGas`, `verificationGasLimit`, and `callGasLimit` values associated with the provided transaction.

- ### [`eth_getUserOperationByHash`](/docs/node/bundler-api/bundler-api-endpoints/eth-get-user-operation-by-hash)

  Returns a transaction based on the given transaction hash. It returns the transaction along with extra information including what block/transaction it was included in. If the transaction has not yet been included, it will return `null`.

- ### [`eth_getUserOperationReceipt`](/docs/node/bundler-api/bundler-api-endpoints/eth-get-user-operation-receipt)

  Returns a transaction receipt ( metadata associated with the given transaction ) based on the given transaction hash. It returns `null` if the transaction has not yet been included.

- ### [`rundler_maxPriorityFeePerGas`](/docs/node/bundler-api/bundler-api-endpoints/rundler-max-priority-fee-per-gas)

  Returns a fee per gas that is an estimate of how much you should set as a priority fee in transactions for Rundler endpoints.

- ### [`eth_supportedEntryPoints`](/docs/node/bundler-api/bundler-api-endpoints/eth-supported-entry-points)

  Returns a list of entry point contract addresses supported by the bundler endpoints.
