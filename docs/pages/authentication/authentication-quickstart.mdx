## Overview

Set up authentication in the Dashboard so users can sign in and start using their wallet.

## Prerequisites

- App created in the Dashboard

## 1. Enable login methods

In the Dashboard, open the authentication settings and enable the login methods you want to support. See the [login methods](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/social-login) section for more details.

### Custom clients

If you bring your own OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret instead of using the default managed clients,
make sure that you allow the signer callback URL in the OAuth provider's settings (usually labeled "Authorized redirect URIs"). Use this callback URL: `https://signer.alchemy.com/callback`.

<Info>
  Do not add your app's redirect URI here. You will allow your app's redirect
  URI in a later step.
</Info>

## 2. Choose an authentication mode

Choose between two modes: `popup` or `redirect`. These modes control your application's navigation flow and how the OAuth provider's authentication is accessed.

- `popup`: Stays on current page, opens a popup to the selected provider and, after sign-in, injects user credentials into the current session.

- `redirect`: Performs a full-page redirect to the provider. After sign-in it injects user credentials into the current session and redirects to a deep link (for React Native) or a webpage that you choose.

  <Tab title="Redirect">
    ```ts twoslash
    authenticateAsync({
      // For react native this can be a direct deeplink in your app e.g. account-kit-expo-quickstart://home
      // or a webpage that deeplinks to a page in your app
      redirectUrl: "https://demo.alchemy.com/",
      mode: "redirect",
      authProviderId: "google",
      type: "oauth",
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Popup">
    <Info>Not supported on React Native</Info>
    ```ts twoslash
    await authenticateAsync({
      mode: "popup",
      authProviderId: "google",
      type: "oauth",
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Allow redirect URIs

If you use `redirect`, you must allow your redirect URI in the Dashboard.

<Info>
  If you redirect to a webpage that then redirects to a React Native in-app deep
  link, allow the deep link, not the webpage.
