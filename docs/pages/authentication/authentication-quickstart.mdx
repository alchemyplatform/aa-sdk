## Overview

Set up authentication in the Dashboard so users can sign in and start using their wallet.

## Prerequisites

- App created in the Dashboard

## 1. Enable login methods

In the Dashboard, open the authentication settings and enable the login methods you want to support. See the login methods section for more details.

### Custom clients

If you bring your own OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret instead of using the default managed clients,
make sure that you allow the signer callback URL in the OAuth provider's settings (usually labeled "Authorized redirect URIs"). Use this callback URL: `https://signer.alchemy.com/callback`.

<Info>
  Do not add your app's redirect URI here. You will allow your app's redirect
  URI in a later step.

## 2. Choose an authentication mode

Choose between two modes: `popup` or `redirect`.

- `popup` (React only): Opens a popup to the selected provider and, after sign-in, injects user credentials into the current session.

- `redirect` (React and React Native): Performs a full-page redirect to the provider. After sign-in it injects user credentials into the current session and redirects to a deep link (for React Native) or a webpage that you choose.

### Allow redirect URIs

If you use `redirect`, you must allow your redirect URI in the Dashboard.

  <Tab title="React">
    <Info>Required SDK version: ^v4.59.1</Info>
    In React, you can allow redirects to any valid URL in your web application.

    ```ts twoslash
    authenticateAsync({
      redirectUrl: "https://demo.alchemy.com/",
      mode: "redirect",
      authProviderId: "google",
      type: "oauth",
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    <Info>Required SDK version: ^v4.59.1</Info>
    In React Native, you can redirect to a valid URL or to a deep link in your application. 
    You can also redirect to a webpage that then redirects to a deep link in your application.

    <Info>If you redirect to a webpage that then redirects to an in-app deep link, allow the deep link, not the webpage.</Info>

    ```ts twoslash
    await authenticateAsync({
      redirectUrl: "account-kit-expo-quickstart://oauth-callback",
      mode: "redirect",
      authProviderId: "google",
      type: "oauth",
    });
    ```
