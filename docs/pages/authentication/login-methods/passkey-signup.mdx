Passkeys provide a secure, passwordless authentication method that can be used to create wallets for your users without going through email verification flows. You can implement passkey signup with or without an associated email address.

    ## Implementation Options

    You can implement Passkey Signup authentication in two ways:

    - [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
    - [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

    ## Pre-built UI Components

    Smart Wallets provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Passkey Signup authentication flow with minimal code.

    ### Step 1: Add Authentication Components to Your Page

    Before configuring your authentication, first add one of the pre-built components to your application:

    <Markdown src="../shared/modal-auth-example.mdx" />

    Or:

    <Markdown src="../shared/embedded-auth-example.mdx" />

    ### Step 2: Configure Passkey Signup in UI Components

    After adding the components, configure the Passkey Signup authentication in your application config:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

    const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
      auth: {
        sections: [
          [
            // Include passkey in a section
            { type: "passkey" },

            // You can combine with other authentication methods
            { type: "email" },
          ],
        ],
        // Enable automatic passkey creation after signup
        addPasskeyOnSignup: true,
      },
    };

    export const config = createConfig(
      {
        transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
        chain: sepolia,
      },
      uiConfig,
    );
    ```

    ## Custom UI

    If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Passkey Signup authentication using Smart Wallets hooks.

    ### Option 1: Passkey Signup with Email (Recommended)

    This approach associates an email with the passkey, allowing users to recover their account if they lose access to their device.

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // When the user submits their email and wants to create a passkey
    const handlePasskeySignup = (email: string) => {
      // Important: Validate the email before proceeding
      if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
        // Handle validation error
        return;
      }

      authenticate(
        {
          type: "passkey",
          email,
        },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // Success - passkey created and user authenticated
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle error
          },
        },
      );
    };

    // Simple email validation function
    const isValidEmail = (email: string) => {
      return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
    };
    ```

    <Error>
      It's important that you validate the email before creating an account for the user. This is to prevent users from losing access to their wallets if they lose their device.
    </Error>

    ### Option 2: Passkey Signup without Email

    This approach creates a passkey without an associated email. Use this only if you have another recovery mechanism in place.

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // When the user wants to create a passkey without email
    const handlePasskeyOnlySignup = (username: string) => {
      authenticate(
        {
          type: "passkey",
          createNew: true,
          username, // A unique identifier for the passkey
        },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // Success - passkey created and user authenticated
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle error
          },
        },
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

    Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

    // You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
    ```

    ## Other JS Frameworks

    It is possible to create wallets for users using just a passkey. This is useful for creating wallets for users if you don't want to go through the email OTP or magic link flow.

    ## Authenticate a user with email and passkey

    If you want to allow sign-up and login with a passkey, you can ask the user for an email to associate with their passkey. This way, they can log in with their email or passkey in the future. Under the hood, the email is also used to check if an account exists already so you can have a unified sign-up and login flow.

    <Error>
      It's important that you validate this email before creating an account for the user. This is to prevent users from losing access to their wallets if they lose their device.
    </Error>

    ```ts twoslash
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    const result = await signer.authenticate({
      type: "passkey",
      email: "user@mail.com",
    });
    ```
