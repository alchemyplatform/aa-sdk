<Info>
  SMS auth is currently in closed alpha. If you'd like early access please reach

</Info>

Authenticate users with their phone number by sending verification codes via SMS.

## How It Works

SMS authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their phone number and requests a verification code. This will trigger a text message with a 6-digit code to their phone number.
2. The user enters the 6-digit code they receive via SMS to complete authentication

The SDK will handle phone number validation, code generation, and delivery automatically.

Pricing varies by country and requires specific area codes to be enabled for your account. An overview of the current SMS costs can be found below.

## Prerequisites

- Early access to SMS auth configured on your account: [Request early access!]()
- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- [Smart Wallets installed and configured in your project](/docs/wallets/pages/react/setup.mdx)
- [A "pay gas with any token" policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create)
- SDK version â‰¥v4.53.0

## Implementation

    <Info>
      SMS auth is not yet supported with pre-built UI components. Please follow
      [this guide](/wallets/react/react-hooks) to
      set up custom UI and configure authentication with hooks.
    </Info>
    ### Step 1: Send the SMS verification code
    Ensure you pass the phone number including the country code in the format `+<country code><phone number>`.
    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react"

    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate()

    const handleSendCode = (email: string) => {
      authenticate(
        { type: "sms", phone: "+123456789" },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email OTP + optional MFA).
            // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle error
          },
        },
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 2: Show OTP input on status change
    Use the `useSignerStatus` hook and `AlchemySignerStatus` enum to react to status changes:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import React from "react";
    import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

    const TrackStatus = () => {
      const { status } = useSignerStatus();

      return (
        <>
          {status === AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_SMS_AUTH && (
            <div>Prompt the user to enter the OTP code received via SMS</div>
          )}
        </>
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 3: Verify the OTP code
    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // When the user submits the OTP code
    const handleVerifyCode = (otpCode: string) => {
      authenticate(
        {
          type: "otp",
          otpCode,
        },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (SMS OTP).
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle invalid code error
          },
        },
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 4: Check authentication status

    Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

    // You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
    ```

    // send sms verification code
    await signer.authenticate({ type: "sms", phone: "+123456789" })
    ...
    // verify sms verification code
    await signer.authenticate({ type: "otp", otpCode: "123456" })
