<Info>
  SMS auth is currently in closed alpha. If you'd like early access please reach

</Info>

Authenticate users with their phone number by sending verification codes via SMS.

## How It Works

SMS authentication is a two-step process:

1. _Send the verification code:_ the user enters their phone number and requests a verification code.
2. _Submit the verification code:_ the user enters the 6-digit code they receive via SMS to complete authentication.

The SDK will handle phone number validation, code generation, and delivery automatically.

We support all major countries across Europe, Asia, North and South America.

Pricing varies by country and requires specific area codes to be enabled for your account. An overview of the current SMS costs can be found below.

## Prerequisites

- Early access to SMS auth configured on your account: [Request early access!](mailto:support@alchemy.com)
- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- [Smart Wallets installed and configured in your project](/wallets/pages/react/setup.mdx)
- [A "pay gas with any token" policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create)
- SDK version â‰¥v4.53.0

        <Info>
        SMS auth is not yet supported with pre-built UI components. Please follow [this guide](/wallets/pages/react/react-hooks) to set up custom UI and configure authentication with hooks.
        </Info>
        ### Step 1: Send the SMS verification code
        Ensure you pass the phone number including the country code in the format `+<country code><phone number>`.
        ```tsx twoslash
        import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react"

        const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate()

        const handleSendCode = (phone: string) => {
        authenticate(
            { type: "sms", phone: "+123456789" },
            {
                onSuccess: () => {
                    // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (SMS OTP + optional MFA).
                    // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
                },
                onError: (error) => {
                    // Handle error
                },
            },
        );
        };
        ```

        ### Step 2: Show OTP input on status change
        Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to show the otp input once the code is sent:

        ```tsx twoslash
        import React from "react";
        import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";
        import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

        const TrackStatus = () => {
        const { status } = useSignerStatus();

        return (
            <>
                {status === AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_SMS_AUTH && (
                    <div>Prompt the user to enter the OTP code received via SMS</div>
                )}
            </>
        );
        };
        ```

        ### Step 3: Verify the OTP code
        ```tsx twoslash
        import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

        const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

        // When the user submits the OTP code
        const handleVerifyCode = (otpCode: string) => {
        authenticate(
            {
            type: "otp",
            otpCode,
            },
            {
                onSuccess: () => {
                    // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (SMS OTP).
                },
                onError: (error) => {
                    // Handle invalid code error
                },
            },
        );
        };
        ```

        ### Step 4: Check authentication status

        Use the `useSignerStatus` hook we set up before to wait until the user is authenticated:

        ```tsx twoslash
        import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

        // Inside your component
        const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

        // You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
        ```

                    // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (SMS OTP + optional MFA).
                    // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
                },
                onError: (error) => {
                    // Handle error
                },
            },
        );
        };
        ```

                {status === AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_SMS_AUTH && (
                    <View>Prompt the user to enter the OTP code received via SMS</View>

                },
