Email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a verification code
2. The user enters the 6-digit code they receive in their inbox to complete authentication

    ## Overview

    You can implement Email OTP authentication in two ways:

    - [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
    - [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

    ## Pre-built UI Components

    Smart Wallets provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Email OTP authentication flow with minimal code.

    ### Step 1: Add Authentication Components to Your Page

    Before configuring your authentication, first add one of the pre-built components to your application:

    <Markdown src="../shared/modal-auth-example.mdx" />

    Or:

    <Markdown src="../shared/embedded-auth-example.mdx" />

    ### Step 2: Configure Email OTP in UI Components

    After adding the components, configure the Email OTP authentication in your application config:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

    const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
      auth: {
        sections: [
          [
            {
              type: "email",
              emailMode: "otp",

              // Optional customizations:
              buttonLabel: "Continue with Email",
              placeholder: "Enter your email address",
            },
          ],
        ],
      },
    };

    export const config = createConfig(
      {
        transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
        chain: sepolia,
      },
      uiConfig,
    );
    ```

    ## Custom UI

    If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Email OTP authentication using Smart Wallets hooks.

    ### Step 1: Send the OTP

    First, prompt your user for their email address and send an OTP:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // When the user submits their email
    const handleSendCode = (email: string) => {
      authenticate(
        {
          type: "email",
          emailMode: "otp",
          email,
        },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email OTP + optional MFA).
            // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle error
          },
        },
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 2: Show OTP Input on Status Change

    Use the `useSignerStatus` hook and `AlchemySignerStatus` enum to react to status changes:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import React from "react";
    import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

    const TrackStatus = () => {
      const { status } = useSignerStatus();

      return (
        <>
          {status === AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_EMAIL_AUTH && (
            <div>Prompt the user to enter the OTP code</div>
          )}
        </>
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 3: Verify the OTP

    Once the user receives the code, they'll enter it in your application:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // When the user submits the OTP code
    const handleVerifyCode = (otpCode: string) => {
      authenticate(
        {
          type: "otp",
          otpCode,
        },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email OTP + optional MFA).
            // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle invalid code error
          },
        },
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 4: Check authentication status

    Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

    // You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
    ```

    ## Other JS Frameworks

    Email OTP authentication allows you to log in and sign up users using an email address. Your users will receive six-digit code in their inbox which they can enter in your site to complete login.

    <Tip>
      For setting up an account config, see the [Signer Quickstart](/wallets/signer/quickstart).
    </Tip>

    ## Authenticate a user

    ```ts twoslash
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    // send the email
    // Promise resolves when the user is fully authenticated (OTP + optional MFA),
    // even if final step completes in another tab/window
    await signer.authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "otp",
      email: "user@mail.com",
    });

    // later once the user has entered the code from their email
    // Promise resolves when the user is fully authenticated (OTP + optional MFA),
    // even if final step completes in another tab/window
    await signer.authenticate({
      type: "otp",
      otpCode: "123456",
    });
    ```

    ### Track Authentication Status

    Use `signer.on("statusChanged", callback)` and the `AlchemySignerStatus` enum to respond to OTP/MFA prompts and completion:

    ```ts twoslash
    import { signer } from "./signer";
    import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

    signer.on("statusChanged", (status) => {
      switch (status) {
        case AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_EMAIL_AUTH:
          // show OTP input UI
          break;
        case AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_MFA_AUTH:
          // show TOTP input UI
          break;
        case AlchemySignerStatus.CONNECTED:
          // authentication complete
          break;
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

### Add Authenticator App (TOTP) Verification (Optional)

If you'd like to add a **second security step** to Email OTP, you can enable [Multi-Factor Authentication](/wallets/react/mfa/setup-mfa). This prompts users for a **6-digit TOTP code** from their authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy) after they verify their email.
