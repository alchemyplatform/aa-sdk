Email magic link authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a magic link
2. The user clicks the link in their email, which redirects them back to your application to complete authentication

<Tip>
  Email OTP has been shown to have up to a 3x higher conversion rate and a 10-second faster flow compared to magic links. Consider using [Email OTP](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/email-otp) for better user experience.

    ## Implementation Options

    You can implement Email Magic Link authentication in two ways:

    - [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
    - [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

    ## Pre-built UI Components

    Smart Wallets provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Email Magic Link authentication flow with minimal code.

    ### Step 1: Add Authentication Components to Your Page

    Before configuring your authentication, first add one of the pre-built components to your application:

    <Markdown src="../shared/modal-auth-example.mdx" />

    Or:

    <Markdown src="../shared/embedded-auth-example.mdx" />

    ### Step 2: Configure Email Magic Link in UI Components

    After adding the components, configure the Email Magic Link authentication in your application config:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
    import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

    const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
      auth: {
        sections: [
          [
            {
              type: "email",
              emailMode: "magicLink",

              // Optional customizations:
              buttonLabel: "Continue with Email",
              placeholder: "Enter your email address",
            },
          ],
        ],
      },
    };

    export const config = createConfig(
      {
        transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
        chain: sepolia,
      },
      uiConfig,
    );
    ```

    ## Custom UI

    If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Email Magic Link authentication using Smart Wallets hooks.

    ### Step 1: Send the Magic Link

    First, prompt your user for their email address and send a magic link:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // When the user submits their email
    const handleSendMagicLink = (email: string) => {
      authenticate(
        {
          type: "email",
          emailMode: "magicLink",
          email,
        },
        {
          onSuccess: () => {
            // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email magic link + optional MFA).
            // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
          },
          onError: (error) => {
            // Handle error
          },
        },
      );
    };
    ```

    ### Step 2: Handle the Redirect

    When the user clicks the magic link in their email, they'll be redirected back to your application. You need to extract the authentication bundle from the URL and complete the authentication:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useEffect } from "react";
    import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

    // Handle the redirect when the component mounts
    useEffect(() => {
      const handleRedirect = () => {
        const url = new URL(window.location.href);
        const bundle = url.searchParams.get("bundle");

        if (bundle) {
          authenticate(
            {
              type: "email",
              bundle,
            },
            {
              onSuccess: () => {
                // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email magic link + optional MFA).
                // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
              },
              onError: (error) => {
                // Handle error
              },
            },
          );
        }
      };

      handleRedirect();
    }, [authenticate]);
    ```

    ### Step 3: Track Authentication Status

    Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

    // You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
    ```

    ## Other JS Frameworks

    Email magic link authentication allows you to log in and sign up users using an email address. Your users will receive a link in their inbox which will redirect them to your site (configured in the dashboard) to complete login.

    <Tip>
      We recommend using the OTP email flow instead, as it is more reliable across different browser environments. OTP flows have also been shown to have up to a 3x higher conversion rate and a 10-second faster flow compared to magic link.

      For setting up the OTP flow, see [Email OTP Authentication](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/email-otp).

      For setting up an account config, see the [Signer Quickstart](/wallets/signer/quickstart).
    </Tip>

    ## Authenticate a user

    ```ts twoslash
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    // send the email
    // resolves when the user is fully authenticated (magic link + optional MFA), even if completion happens in another tab/window
    await signer.authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "magicLink",
      email: "user@mail.com",
    });

    // later once the user has clicked the link
    const url = new URL(window.location.href);
    const bundle = url.searchParams.get("bundle");
    if (!bundle) {
      throw new Error("No bundle found in URL");
    }

    // resolves when the user is fully authenticated (magic link + optional MFA), even if completion happens in another tab/window
    await signer.authenticate({
      type: "email",
      bundle,
    });
    ```

    ### Track Authentication Status

    Use `signer.on("statusChanged", callback)` and the `AlchemySignerStatus` enum to respond to OTP/MFA prompts and completion:

    ```ts twoslash
    import { signer } from "./signer";
    import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

    signer.on("statusChanged", (status) => {
      switch (status) {
        case AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_EMAIL_AUTH:
          // show OTP input UI
          break;
        case AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_MFA_AUTH:
          // show TOTP input UI
          break;
        case AlchemySignerStatus.CONNECTED:
          // authentication complete
          break;
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

### Add Authenticator App (TOTP) Verification (Optional)

Consider enabling [Multi-Factor Authentication](/wallets/react/mfa/setup-mfa) to require users to enter a 6-digit TOTP code from their authenticator app after clicking the magic link. This extra layer of security protects user accounts if their email is compromised.
