Authentication is the foundation of seamless web3 user experiences. Alchemy Smart Wallets enables you to onboard users with familiar login methods while maintaining the security and decentralization benefits of blockchain technology.

## Why Authentication Matters in Web3

Traditional blockchain authentication creates significant barriers to user adoption:

- **Complex private key management** - Users must securely store and manage cryptographic keys
- **Wallet installation requirements** - Additional software downloads and setup
- **Technical knowledge barriers** - Understanding of blockchain concepts and wallet security
- **Poor user experience** - Lengthy onboarding flows and confusing interfaces

Alchemy Smart Wallets solves these challenges by providing **web2-familiar authentication** that creates **web3-native smart accounts** behind the scenes.

## Core Authentication Features

### Multiple Authentication Methods

Choose from a variety of authentication options to match your users' preferences:

- **[Email OTP](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/email-otp)** - Passwordless login with 6-digit verification codes
- **[Email Magic Links](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/email-magic-link)** - One-click authentication via secure email links
- **[Social Login](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/social-login)** - OAuth with Google, Apple, Discord, Twitter, and more
- **[Passkey Authentication](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/passkey-signup)** - Biometric and hardware-based passwordless login
- **[Bring Your Own Auth](/wallets/authentication/login-methods/bring-your-own-auth)** - Integrate existing JWT/OIDC authentication systems

### Flexible Implementation Options

Implement authentication in the way that best fits your application:

- **Pre-built UI Components** - Deploy quickly with minimal code using `<AuthCard />` or `<AuthModal />`
- **Custom UI Integration** - Build completely custom experiences with headless React hooks
- **Modal or Embedded Flows** - Choose between popup modals or embedded authentication forms
- **Whitelabel Solutions** - Customize theming and branding to match your application

### Enterprise-Grade Security

- **Non-custodial Architecture** - Users maintain full control over their private keys
- **Secure Enclave Storage** - Keys generated and stored in hardware security modules
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - Additional security layers for high-value operations
- **Account Recovery** - Flexible recovery options through trusted contacts or backup methods

## Understanding Signers

A **Signer** is the service or application that manages private keys and signs operations for your users. With Alchemy Smart Wallets:

- **Alchemy Signer** - Our secure, non-custodial signer service powered by Turnkey's secure enclaves
- **Third-Party Signers** - Integration with existing wallet providers like MetaMask
- **User Control** - Only end users can access their keys, not Alchemy or your application

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Add additional security layers for sensitive operations:

- **Email OTP MFA** - Secondary verification via email codes
- **Email Magic Link MFA** - Additional verification via email links
- **Social Login MFA** - Secondary authentication through social providers

## Implementation Approaches

### Quick Start with Pre-built Components

Deploy authentication in minutes with minimal code:

```tsx twoslash
import { AuthCard } from "@account-kit/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <AuthCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Markdown src="./shared/modal-auth-example.mdx" />

### Custom UI with React Hooks

Build completely custom authentication experiences:

```tsx twoslash
import {
  useAuthenticate,
  useSignerStatus,
  useAuthModal,
} from "@account-kit/react";

function CustomAuth() {
  const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();
  const { isInitializing, isConnected } = useSignerStatus();
  const { openAuthModal } = useAuthModal();

  const handleEmailAuth = async () => {
    await authenticate({
      type: "email",
      email: "user@example.com",
    });
  };

  if (isInitializing) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (isConnected) return <div>Welcome back!</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleEmailAuth}>Login with Email</button>
      <button onClick={openAuthModal}>Show Auth Modal</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
