The `SmartAccountClient` within `@aa-sdk/core` is unopinionated about which paymaster you use, so you can connect to any paymaster really simply. Configuration is done using the `paymasterAndData` config option when you call `createSmartAccountClient`.

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { createSmartAccountClient } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { http } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const chain = sepolia;
const client = createSmartAccountClient({
  chain,
  transport: http("RPC_URL"),
  // sets the dummy paymasterAndData with paymaster address appended with some dummy paymasterData
  // that looks like a valid paymasterData
  dummyPaymasterAndData: async (userop) => ({
    ...userop,
    paymasterAndData: `0x<PAYMASTER_ADDRESS><PAYMASTER_DUMMY_DATA>`,
  }),
  paymasterAndData: async (userop, opts) => {
    // call your paymaster here to sponsor the userop
    // leverage the `opts` field to apply any overrides
    return {
      ...userop,
      paymasterAndData: "0xresponsefromprovider",
    };
  },
});
```
