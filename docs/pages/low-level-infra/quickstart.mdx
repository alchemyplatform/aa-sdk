In this guide, we'll cover how to get started with `@account-kit/infra` and send a user operation. For smart contracts, we'll leverage `@account-kit/smart-contracts` to use `ModularAccountV2`,
but you're free to use any smart contract you'd like.

## Prerequisites

- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- minimum Typescript version of 5 and the packages below from aa-sdk

**Installation**

<CodeBlocks>

```bash yarn
yarn add @account-kit/infra @account-kit/smart-contracts @aa-sdk/core viem
```

```bash npm
npm i -s @account-kit/infra @account-kit/smart-contracts @aa-sdk/core viem
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Create a Gas Manager policy

If you want to sponsor gas, then you'll also want to create a gas policy in the Gas Manager dashboard.

<Markdown src="../../shared/create-gas-policy.mdx" />

## Create a client

Now that you have an API key and a Policy ID, you can create a [Smart Account Client](/wallets/concepts/smart-account-client) to interact with the infrastructure.

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `POLICY_ID` with the key and Policy ID created
  above.
</Warning>

<Markdown src="../../shared/infra/mav2-client.mdx" />

## Send a user operation

The last step is to send a user operation using the client you just created.

<CodeBlocks>

```ts twoslash example.ts
import { getClient } from "./client";

const client = await getClient();

const { hash } = await client.sendUserOperation({
  uo: {
    target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
    data: "0x",
    value: 0n,
  },
});
```

</CodeBlocks>
