# Lower Level Infra Overview

Smart Wallets is composed of some lower-level libraries if you're looking for further customization of your stack or want more control over how you build your application and use third party providers.
One of these libraries is `@account-kit/infra` which allows you to interact with our infrastructure directly, while bringing your own smart contracts or signer.

If you do not need customization, we highly recommend that you use our Wallet APIs to simplify development.
