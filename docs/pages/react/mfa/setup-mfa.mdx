  <Tab title="React">
    With Smart Wallets, multi-factor authentication (MFA) uses authenticator apps—like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator—to generate a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP).

    By requiring both a user's primary login (e.g., email OTP, magic link, or social login) and a TOTP from their authenticator app, your application gains an extra layer of security.

    <Tip>
      Multi-factor authentication requires a primary authentication method (Email
      OTP, Email Magic Link, or Social Login) to be already set up. See the [React
      Quickstart](/wallets/react/quickstart) guide to set up your primary
      authentication method first.
    </Tip>

    ## Prerequisites

    Before implementing MFA, you need to have:

    1. **Set up primary authentication** - MFA requires a primary authentication method to be already set up. Follow the [React Quickstart](/wallets/react/quickstart) guide to configure email (OTP or magic link) or social login.
    2. **Working authentication flow** - Ensure users can successfully sign in with your primary authentication method.

    ## Implementation

    To implement authenticator app verification in your React application, you'll use the `useMFA` hook from Smart Wallets.

    ### Step 1: Checking if Multi-Factor Authentication is Available

    First, check if the user is logged in and able to edit their MFA settings:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import React from "react";
    import { useMFA } from "@account-kit/react";

    // Inside your component
    const { isReady } = useMFA();

    // Only show MFA setup options if available
    if (isReady) {
      // Render MFA setup UI
    } else {
      // User needs to authenticate first
    }
    ```

    ### Step 2: Setting Up an Authenticator App

    In this step, we receive a QR code URL from the backend and display it to the user. This URL contains a TOTP seed and necessary metadata. When displayed as a QR code, it can be scanned by most authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.) to set up 6-digit time-based codes. The backend also provides a unique multiFactorId which we'll need to store for the verification step.

    ```tsx twoslash
    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { QRCodeSVG } from "qrcode.react";
    import { useMFA } from "@account-kit/react";

    function AuthenticatorSetupComponent() {
      const { addMFA } = useMFA();
      const [qrCodeUrl, setQrCodeUrl] = useState("");
      const [factorId, setFactorId] = useState("");

      const handleSetupAuthenticator = () => {
        // Use the mutate method from the mutation result
        addMFA.mutate(
          {
            multiFactorType: "totp", // Technical name for authenticator apps
          },
          {
            onSuccess: (result) => {
              // Store the QR code URL and factor ID
              setQrCodeUrl(result.multiFactorTotpUrl);
              // Store the factor ID which will be needed for verification in the next step
              // This ID uniquely identifies the MFA factor being configured
              setFactorId(result.multiFactorId);
            },
            onError: (error) => {
              console.error("Failed to set up authenticator app:", error);
            },
          },
        );
      };

      // You can also check loading state directly
      const isLoading = addMFA.isPending;

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={handleSetupAuthenticator} disabled={isLoading}>
            {isLoading ? "Setting up..." : "Set Up Authenticator App"}
          </button>

          {qrCodeUrl && (
            <div className="qr-container">
              <h3>Scan this QR code with your authenticator app</h3>
              <QRCodeSVG value={qrCodeUrl} size={200} />
              <p>
                After scanning, enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
                to complete setup.
              </p>
            </div>
          )}

          {/* Display errors if they occur */}
          {addMFA.isError && (
            <div className="error">Error: {addMFA.error.message}</div>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    This QR code contains the information needed for apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. Once scanned, the app will generate 6-digit codes that users can use as their second verification step.

    ### Step 3: Confirming the Authenticator App Setup

    After the user scans the QR code, they need to prove it worked by entering a code:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { useMFA } from "@account-kit/react";

    function VerifyAuthenticatorComponent({
      multiFactorId,
    }: {
      multiFactorId: string;
    }) {
      const { verifyMFA } = useMFA();
      const [code, setCode] = useState("");

      const handleVerifyAuthenticator = () => {
        verifyMFA.mutate(
          {
            multiFactorId,
            multiFactorCode: code, // The TOTP code from the user's authenticator app
          },
          {
            onSuccess: () => {
              // Authenticator setup successful
              console.log("MFA setup complete!");
            },
            onError: (error) => {
              // Handle error
              console.error("Verification failed:", error);
            },
          },
        );
      };

      // For async/await pattern, you can use mutateAsync
      const handleVerifyAsync = async () => {
        try {
          const result = await verifyMFA.mutateAsync({
            multiFactorId,
            multiFactorCode: code,
          });
          console.log("MFA setup complete!", result);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Verification failed:", error);
        }
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <input
            type="text"
            value={code}
            onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Enter 6-digit code"
            maxLength={6}
          />
          <button
            onClick={handleVerifyAuthenticator}
            disabled={verifyMFA.isPending}
          >
            {verifyMFA.isPending ? "Verifying..." : "Verify Code"}
          </button>

          {verifyMFA.isError && (
            <div className="error">Invalid code. Please try again.</div>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    ### Step 4: Managing Authenticator Apps

    You can retrieve and remove authenticator app–based MFA from a user's account by using the `useMFA` hook. Each verification method (also called a "factor") is identified by a unique `multiFactorId`. For example, a TOTP-based authenticator app is one factor.

    ```tsx twoslash
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
    import { useMFA } from "@account-kit/react";
    import type { MfaFactor } from "@account-kit/signer";

    function ManageMfaComponent() {
      const { getMFAFactors, removeMFA } = useMFA();
      const [factors, setFactors] = useState<MfaFactor[]>([]);

      // Fetch all MFA verification methods (factors) for the current user
      useEffect(() => {
        // Only fetch when component mounts and we're ready
        getMFAFactors.mutate(undefined, {
          onSuccess: (result) => {
            // factors.multiFactors is an array of verification methods
            setFactors(result.multiFactors);
          },
        });
      }, [getMFAFactors]);

      // Remove a TOTP authenticator app by its multiFactorId
      const handleRemoveAuthenticator = (multiFactorId: string) => {
        removeMFA.mutate(
          { multiFactorIds: [multiFactorId] },
          {
            onSuccess: () => {
              console.log("Authenticator removed successfully!");
              // Update local state to reflect the removal
              setFactors(factors.filter((f) => f.multiFactorId !== multiFactorId));
            },
          },
        );
      };

      // Loading states are available directly from the mutation objects
      if (getMFAFactors.isPending) return <div>Loading MFA settings...</div>;

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Your Authentication Methods</h2>

          {factors.length === 0 ? (
            <p>No authenticator apps configured.</p>
          ) : (
            <ul>
              {factors.map((factor) => (
                <li key={factor.multiFactorId}>
                  {factor.multiFactorType === "totp"
                    ? "Authenticator App"
                    : factor.multiFactorType}
                  <button
                    onClick={() => handleRemoveAuthenticator(factor.multiFactorId)}
                    disabled={removeMFA.isPending}
                  >
                    Remove
                  </button>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          )}

          {getMFAFactors.isError && (
            <div className="error">
              Error loading MFA settings: {getMFAFactors.error.message}
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    ## Next Steps

    After setting up an authenticator app, users will need to provide both their primary authentication method and a 6-digit code when signing in:

    ### Using Pre-built UI Components

    If you're using the [pre-built UI components](/wallets/react/ui-components), the MFA verification process is handled automatically:

    - The authentication flow will detect when a user has MFA enabled
    - Users will be prompted for their authenticator app code after providing their primary credentials
    - No additional code is required from you

    ### Using Custom UI with Hooks

    If you're implementing [custom UI with hooks](/wallets/react/react-hooks), you'll need to update your authentication code to handle the MFA verification step:

    - [Email OTP with Multi-Factor Authentication](/wallets/react/mfa/email-otp) - See how to implement the two-step verification
    - [Email Magic Link with Multi-Factor Authentication](/wallets/react/mfa/email-magic-link) - Learn how to handle magic links with MFA
    - [Social Login with Multi-Factor Authentication](/wallets/react/mfa/social-login) - Social login with MFA is handled in the OAuth callback

    For custom UI implementations, make sure your authentication logic checks for the MFA requirement and provides UI for users to enter their authenticator app code.

    Alchemy Signer supports Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    This lets you prompt users to set up a TOTP authenticator (e.g. Google Authenticator) as an additional security factor.

    <Tip>
      Multi-factor authentication is currently supported when authenticating with
      Email OTP or Email Magic-link
    </Tip>

    ## Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication

    - Prerequesit: Your user is already logged in with at least one authentication factor (e.g. [email OTP](/wallets/signer/authentication/email-otp), [email magic-link](/wallets/signer/authentication/email-magic-link)).

    ### 1. Add a new TOTP factor

    Once the user is authenticated, you can call `addMfa` to enable TOTP. This returns factor details including an ID and setup information that your app can display to the user (e.g. a QR code or `otpauth` link that the user can scan in Google Authenticator).

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    const { multiFactors } = await signer.addMFA({
      multiFactorType: "totp",
    });

    // Display the QR code or secret to the user
    const totpUrl = result?.multiFactors[0].multiFactorTotpUrl;
    const multiFactorId = result?.multiFactors[0].multiFactorId;
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    You can show the `multiFactorTotpUrl` in your UI as a QR code or link for the user to add it to their authenticator app.

    ### 2. Verify the TOTP setup

    Once the user has scanned the TOTP secret, have them enter the 6-digit code from their authenticator app. Then call `verifyMfa`:

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    await signer.verifyMfa({
      multiFactorId, // from addMfa
      multiFactorCode: "123456",
    });
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ### 3. Remove a TOTP factor

    If a user wants to disable TOTP, call `removeMfa` with the `multiFactorId` you want to remove:

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    await signer.removeMfa({
      multiFactorIds: [multiFactorId],
    });
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ### 4. Get a list of existing MFA factors

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    const { multiFactors } = await signer.getMfaFactors();
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ## Authenticating Email OTP with multi-factor TOTP

    ### Step 1: Send an OTP to user's email

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    signer.authenticate({
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "otp",
      email: "user@mail.com",
    });
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ### Step 2: Submit the email OTP code

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    signer.authenticate({
      type: "otp",
      otpCode: "EMAIL_OTP_CODE",
    });
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ### Step 3: Submit the TOTP code (authenticator app code)

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    const user = await signer?.validateMultiFactors({
      multiFactorCode: totpCode,
    });
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ## Authenticating Email magic-link with multi-factor TOTP

    When calling `authenticate` with `emailMode="magicLink"`, you can catch a `MfaRequiredError`. Then you can collect the TOTP code and resubmit.

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { MfaRequiredError } from "@account-kit/signer";
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    const promptUserForCode = async () => {
      // Prompt user for TOTP code
      // const totpCode = await promptUserForCode();

      return "123456";
    };

    try {
      // Promise resolves when the user is fully authenticated (email magic link + optional MFA),
      // even if completion happens in another tab/window
      await signer.authenticate({
        type: "email",
        email: "user@mail.com",
        emailMode: "magicLink",
      });
    } catch (err) {
      if (err instanceof MfaRequiredError) {
        // Prompt user for TOTP code
        const totpCode = await promptUserForCode();

        const { multiFactorId } = err.multiFactors[0];

        // Promise resolves when the user is fully authenticated (email magic link + optional MFA),
        // even if completion happens in another tab/window
        await signer.authenticate({
          type: "email",
          emailMode: "magicLink",
          email: "user@mail.com",
          multiFactors: [
            {
              multiFactorId,
              multiFactorCode: totpCode,
            },
          ],
        });
      } else {
        // handle other errors
      }
    }
    ```

    <Markdown src="../../../shared/signer/signer.mdx" />

    </CodeBlocks>

    ## Authenticating Social Login with multi-factor TOTP

    When a user has MFA enabled using an authenticator app, the authentication process for social login is seamless. Unlike email authentication flows, you don't need to handle the MFA challenge manually in your code.

    The TOTP verification happens automatically during the OAuth callback flow:

    1. The user authenticates with the social provider (Google, Facebook, etc.)
    2. After successful provider authentication, they're prompted for their TOTP code on the OAuth callback page
    3. Once verified, authentication completes normally

    Simply use the standard social login authentication as shown in the [Social Login Authentication](/wallets/signer/authentication/social-login) guide:

    <CodeBlocks>

    ```ts twoslash example.ts
    import { signer } from "./signer";

    await signer.authenticate({
      type: "oauth",
      authProviderId: "google", // Choose between the auth providers you selected to support from your auth policy
      mode: "redirect", // Alternatively, you can choose "popup" mode
      redirectUrl: "/", // After logging in, redirect to the index page
    });
    ```
