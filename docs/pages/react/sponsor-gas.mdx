# How to sponsor gas for a User Operation

Gas fees are a significant barrier to entry for new user of your app. With Account Kit you can remove this barrier by sponsoring gas fees for transactions via the [Gas Manager](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/gas-manager-services/?a=ak-docs). This guide explains how to sponsor gas by creating a gas policy, linking it to your client, and sending sponsored `UserOperations` (UOs) from a smart account.

After [setting up Account Kit](/wallets/react/quickstart) in your project, follow these steps to sponsor gas.

## Create a Gas Manager policy

<Markdown src="../../shared/create-gas-policy.mdx" />

## Set the Policy ID globally

When creating your Account Kit config, you can optionally pass in a Gas Policy ID. This will enable all UOs sent by the `useSendUserOperation` hook to be sponsored by the policy you created.

Copy it and then replace the `GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID` in the snippet below.

<Tip>
  Remember to replace `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your Alchemy API key. If you don't
  have one yet, you can create an API key on the [Alchemy
  dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=aa-docs).
</Tip>

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// @noErrors
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
  chain: sepolia,
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID", // [!code ++]
});
```

Now you can follow the guide for [Sending user operations](/wallets/react/send-user-operations) to send sponsored UOs from your smart account!

## Set the gas policy ID per UserOperation

If you want more control over which UOs are sponsored, then you can set the policy ID on a specific instance of the `Smart Account Client` returned by the [`useSmartAccountClient`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useSmartAccountClient) hook.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import {
  useSmartAccountClient,
  useSendUserOperation,
} from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({
    policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
  });
  const { sendUserOperation } = useSendUserOperation({ client });

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        sendUserOperation({
          uo: {
            target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
            data: "0x",
            value: 0n,
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Send Sponsored User Operation
    </button>
  );
}
```
