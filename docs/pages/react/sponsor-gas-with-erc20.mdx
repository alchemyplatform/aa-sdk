Gas fees paid in the native network token can still feel foreign to users that primarily hold stablecoins or your app's own token. With **Account Kit** you can let users pay those fees in any ERC-20 token that you approve via the **Gas Manager**.

## Goal

Enable your React app to sponsor gas fees with an ERC-20 token (for example **USDC**) so end-users can pay fees without native ETH.

## Prerequisites

- Account Kit already installed and configured in your project.
- An Alchemy API key.
- A Gas Manager policy of type "Pay gas with any token". (_TODO â€“ link to policy creation guide_)
- The ERC-20 token contract address you want to accept (shown here as `USDC_ADDRESS`).

## Steps

### 1 Add the policy to your global config

```ts twoslash config.ts
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
  chain: sepolia,
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID", // your policy
  policyToken: {
    address: "0x", // USDC_ADDRESS or an ERC-20 token address
    maxTokenAmount: 10_000n, // optional safety limit
  },
});
```

All `UserOperations` sent with the hooks will now be paid with the token configured above.

### 2 Send a sponsored UserOperation

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useSendUserOperation } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function PayWithUsdcButton() {
  const { sendUserOperation } = useSendUserOperation();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        sendUserOperation({
          uo: {
            target: "0xTARGET_ADDRESS",
            data: "0x",
            value: 0n,
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Send USDC-sponsored operation
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 3 (Optional) Override on a single client

If you only want specific operations to use the policy, create a dedicated client instead of setting it globally.

```tsx twoslash
const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({
  policyId: "GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
  policyToken: {
    address: "0x", // USDC_ADDRESS or an ERC-20 token address
    maxTokenAmount: 10_000n,
  },
});
```

Use this `client` with any hook that sends UserOperations.

## Done

Your dApp now sponsors gas with the chosen ERC-20 token!
