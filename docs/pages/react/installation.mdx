In this doc and the three following we will build a Next.js application with Alchemy Smart Wallets from scratch. If you're using any other tech stack, follow along with the key points of integration and adjust as needed!

## Create a new Next.js app

Start by initializing a new [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/). Run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Install Dependencies

You will need these three libraries:

- **@account-kit/infra**: Core interfaces and functions for Smart Wallets ([learn more](wallets/reference/account-kit/infra))
- **@account-kit/react**: React Hooks, components and utilities for Smart Wallets ([learn more](wallets/reference/account-kit/react))
- **@tanstack/react-query**: A required async state library to make smart wallet react hooks easier to use ([learn more about this library's motivation here](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview))

Go ahead and install them to the project with a single command:

<CodeBlocks>

```bash npm
npm install @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @account-kit/infra @account-kit/react @tanstack/react-query
```

</CodeBlocks>
