**By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working NextJS application with embedded smart wallets, social login, and gasless transactions.**

The fastest way to get started is using our **Quickstart widget** in the Alchemy Dashboard.

## 1. Use the Dashboard Quickstart

1. Go to the Smart Wallets Quickstart in the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/quickstart)
2. Click get started to pre-generate an example API key and policy ID for testing
3. Follow the 3-step process:
   - **Create new app**: Copy the provided `npx create-next-app` command
   - **Set up environment**: Copy the pre-configured `.env` variables (includes your API key and policy ID)
   - **Run app**: Use the provided run command

The quickstart widget automatically provides you with:

- ✅ Pre-configured API key (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`)
- ✅ Pre-configured paymaster policy ID (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID`)
- ✅ Ready-to-use commands
- ✅ Default network set to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet
  - Uses an example NFT contract deployed on this network for the demo

## 2. That's it!

Your app will be running with embedded smart wallets using social login, and gas sponsorship enabled out of the box ✨

<Tip>
  The dashboard quickstart creates everything you need automatically. No manual
  API key or policy setup required! Visit the [Login UI
  setup](/wallets/react/getting-started) to start customizing your experience.
