To use Smart Wallets, you need to:

1. Create an app in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup) and copy the **API Key**.

2. Create a **`configuration`** in the [`Smart Wallets` dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) to enable login methods.

3. Create a policy in your [gas manager dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration) to set rules for sponsorship.

Create a `.env` at root of your project:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=YOUR_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID
```
