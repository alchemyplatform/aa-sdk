Account Kit supports fees and rent sponsorship for Solana wallets, enabling users to transact without holding SOL — removing a major barrier to entry for new users of your app.

You can sponsor transaction fees or rent either globally (for all transactions) or on a per-transaction basis.

- **Fees** cover the cost of executing transactions.
- **Rent** is required to store data on-chain.
  - _We support rent sponsorship for `SystemProgram.createAccount` . If you need support for sponsoring rent in custom programs, please contact us at [account-abstraction@alchemy.com](mailto:account-abstraction@alchemy.com)._
- See our [recommendations](https://www.alchemy.com/support/best-practices-to-limit-gas-manager-spend) for gas manager spending.

## Setup

On your gas manager [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager), create a new Solana sponsorship policy. You can customize this policy to set rules on sponsorship like max spend per transaction, max spend per policy, or max transactions per policy.

Make sure you select Solana as the chain type and apply this policy to the app corresponding to the API key you’re using.

## Global sponsorship

If you want to apply a sponsorship policy to all transactions sent by the Solana wallet provider, you can configure fee and rent sponsorship at the Alchemy configuration level by passing a `policyId` into your Solana config.

```tsx [config.ts]
import { cookieStorage, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

createConfig({
	...otherConfig
	solana: {
	  connection: new Connection(
	    "https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<API_KEY>",
	    {
	      wsEndpoint: "wss://api.devnet.solana.com",
	      commitment: "confirmed",
	    }
	  ),
	  policyId: "<PolicyId>"
	}
}
```

This setup applies sponsorship to all Solana transactions sent from wallets created with this configuration (e.g. this will be applied to usage of the `useSolana…` hooks).

### Per transaction sponsorship

If instead, you want to apply sponsorship conditionally for each transaction, you can pass a `policyId` to the `useSolanaTransaction` hook.

```tsx [sponsor-solana-gas.ts]
import { useSolanaTransaction } from "@account-kit/react";
import { Connection, PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";

function MyComponent() {
  const policyId = "<YourPolicyId>";

  const { sendTransaction, signer } = useSolanaTransaction({
    policyId,
  });

  if (!signer) {
    return <div>Loading signer...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        sendTransaction({
          transfer: {
            toAddress: "<ToAddress>",
            amount: 1000000,
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Send Sponsored Transaction
    </button>
  );
}
```
