<Warning>
  Solana Wallet support is in beta. Please [reach
  out](mailto:support@alchemy.com) if you run into any issues or need support
  integrating.
</Warning>

Account Kit supports Solana Smart Wallets, enabling developers to create embedded wallets, sign transactions, sponsor gas, and batch transactions on Solana. This integration allows developers to create both EVM and Solana wallets with social login and use those wallets alongside existing Solana libraries like `@solana/web3.js` to build seamless, gas-less user experiences.

Check out the [demo](https://demo.alchemy.com/) to see Solana wallets with gas sponsorship in action.

Key features:

- Create Solana wallets with [email, social login, passkeys, etc](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/getting-started).
- Sign messages and transactions
- Send transactions
- Sponsor gas for Solana transactions
- Batch multiple Solana instructions in a single transaction

This guide will walk you through setting up and using Solana Smart Wallets with Alchemy Account Kit.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Set up your login methods and user [authentication](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/getting-started)
- Installed a Solana library, such as `@solana/web3.js` to handle transaction construction and submission
  ```bash
  npm install @solana/web3.js
  ```
- A Solana RPC endpoint (e.g. `https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>`). Create an app on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps) and enable Solana AND EVM networks (you'll need both).
- The latest `@account-kit/react` package installed:
  ```bash
  npm install @account-kit/react
  ```

# Creating a Solana Wallet

With Account Kit, you can generate a Solana wallet using familiar auth methods (ex: email, Google, or passkeys). All users get both an EVM and a Solana address after authenticating.

First, make sure you have already set up login methods and completed user [authentication](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/getting-started).

Adjust your config to add Solana support. Set up your Solana connection using the `solana` parameter in `createConfig`. This is where you’ll add your Alchemy RPC URL.

Note that you’ll still need to set a chain parameter. You can choose any random EVM chain that your app has enabled like `sepolia`.

```ts [config.tsx]
import { cookieStorage, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";
...
createConfig({
  ...otherConfig
  chain: sepolia,
  solana: {
    connection: new Connection(
      "https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<API_KEY>",
      {
        wsEndpoint: "wss://api.devnet.solana.com",
        commitment: "confirmed",
      }
    ),
    policyId: "<PolicyId>" // Optional - gas/rent sponsorship policy ID: https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager
  }
}
```

# Getting a Solana Wallet address

Once a user has been authenticated, you can retrieve their Solana wallet address in 2 ways:

## Using `useSolanaSigner` hook

If you just want the Solana wallet address and signer, you can use this hook.

```jsx
import { useSolanaSigner } from "@account-kit/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const signer = useSolanaSigner({});

  if (!signer) {
    return <div>Loading signer...</div>;
  }

  return <div>Solana Address: {signer.address}</div>;
}
```

## Using `useSolanaTransaction` hook

If you want to connect to a user’s Solana Wallet and send transactions, you should use the [`useSolanaTransaction`](/wallets/pages/react/solana-wallets/signing-and-sending-solana#sign-messages-with-usesolanasignmessage) hook for simplicity. This hook also exposes the Solana wallet address.

**Not using React hooks?**

You can convert any Alchemy [signer](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/signer/quickstart) instance into a Solana-compatible signer using the `SolanaSigner` class. [See Signer Solana docs](/wallets/pages/core/solana-wallets/solana-signer-package).
