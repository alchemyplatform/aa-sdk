description: How to connect to bring in your own EOAs to Account Kit
---

You can log into Account Kit using your own EOA! This can be done using our pre-built UI components or custom UI.
Depending on what method you choose, you can bring in your EOA:

- As a "pure" EOA, meaning it will not have access to Account Abstraction (AA) features.
- As an owner and signer of your Alchemy smart account, which will give you access to AA features.

## Pre-built Components

Easily log in into your existing EOAs using popular wallet providers like **MetaMask**, **Rabby**, **Phantom**, and more.
Note: You will not have access to Account Abstraction features here; this external, "pure" EOA will be purely used as an EOA.

Our SDK supports external wallet connection out of the box, so you can seamlessly support both Web2 users with social login and Web3 users who want to bring their own EOAs.We support enabling users to bring their existing EOA in 2 ways:

1. **Automatically detect and display all wallet extensions available in the user's browser.** (_Note: if the user has no wallet extensions installed, nothing will be displayed_)
2. **WalletConnect for all other EOAs**

With Account Kit, users can still connect to their existing wallets without sacrificing compatibility or convenience.

Our hooks will handle checking if the connected wallet is a smart wallet or an existing EOA.
Transactions can be signed and sent in the same way, but external EOA wallets don't have access to Account Abstraction benefits such as gas abstraction, batching, etc.
These EOAs will simply function as EOAs.

In order to access these external wallet providers, just make sure to include configure `type: "external_wallets"` in your config:

```ts twoslash [src/config.ts]
// @noErrors
import { createConfig, cookieStorage } from "@account-kit/react";
import { alchemy, sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    // alchemy config
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your_api_key" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - setup your app and embedded account config in the alchemy dashboard (https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)
    chain: sepolia, // TODO: specify your preferred chain here and update imports from @account-kit/infra
    ssr: true, // Defers hydration of the account state to the client after the initial mount solving any inconsistencies between server and client state (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr)
    storage: cookieStorage, // persist the account state using cookies (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state)
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
    // optional config to override default session manager config
    sessionConfig: {
      expirationTimeMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 60 minutes (default is 15 min)
    },
  },
  {
    // authentication ui config - your customizations here
    auth: {
      sections: [
        [{ type: "email" }],
        [
          { type: "passkey" },
          { type: "social", authProviderId: "google", mode: "popup" },
          { type: "social", authProviderId: "facebook", mode: "popup" },
        ],
        [
          {
            type: "external_wallets",
            walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
          },
        ],
      ],
      addPasskeyOnSignup: true,
      showSignInText: true,
    },
  },
);
```

In order to access other providers via `WalletConnect`, **also** add `walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" }` to your config:

```ts twoslash [src/config.ts]
// @noErrors
[
  {
    type: "external_wallets",
    walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
  },
];
```

## Custom UI

### React Hooks

If you need complete control over the user experience, you can customize your EOA login. This is a "pure" EOA and will not have access to AA features:

For example, using [useConnect](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useConnect)

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
import { useConnect } from "@account-kit/react";

const { connectors, connect } = useConnect({
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    console.log("Connected!", data);
  },
  onError: (err) => {
    console.error("Connection failed", err);
  },
});

return (
  <div>
    {connectors.map((connector) => (
      <button key={connector.id} onClick={() => connect({ connector })}>
        Connect with {connector.name}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### EIP-1193-Compatible Provider Integration

For wallets that support the [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) standard (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.), you can use `WalletClientSigner` from `@aa-sdk/core`. More info [here](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/third-party/signers).
This EOA is made an owner of your smart account and has access to AA features:

```ts
// @noErrors
import { WalletClientSigner, type SmartAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const externalProvider = window.ethereum; // or another EIP-1193 provider

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: custom(externalProvider),
});

export const signer: SmartAccountSigner = new WalletClientSigner(
  walletClient,
  "json-rpc",
);
```

### üîê Local Account Integration

Local Account refers to an EOA where the private key is directly accessible on the client. This EOA is made an owner of your smart account and has access to AA features:

```ts
// @noErrors
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem";

const signer = new LocalAccountSigner(
  privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()),
);

const account = await createModularAccountV2({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: alchemyTransport,
  signer: signer,
});
```
