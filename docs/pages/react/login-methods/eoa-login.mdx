## Use Your Own EOA as a Signer

You can bring in your own EOAs to use as **owners and signers** of your smart account. This gives you full custody and control over how your smart account is managed, while still enabling access to powerful **Account Abstraction (AA)** features like:

- **Gas sponsorship via Paymasters**
- **Session keys**
- **Custom authorization flows**
- And more

## üîå For EIP-1193-Compatible Providers (e.g. MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)

For wallets that support the [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) standard (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.), you can use `WalletClientSigner` from `@aa-sdk/core`. More info [here](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/third-party/signers).

```ts
// @noErrors
import { WalletClientSigner, type SmartAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const externalProvider = window.ethereum; // or another EIP-1193 provider

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: custom(externalProvider),
});

export const signer: SmartAccountSigner = new WalletClientSigner(
  walletClient,
  "json-rpc",
);
```

## üîê For Public/Private Key Pairs (Embedded or Backend)

To bring in your own **public/private key pair** and use it as a signer in AccountKit, you can manually implement the `SmartAccountSigner` interface. More info [here](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/third-party/signers).

This is fully supported and gives you the flexibility to integrate with **embedded wallets**, **server-side signers**, or **secure enclaves**.

Here's an example using `viem`'s `privateKeyToAccount` utility:

```ts
// @noErrors
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import type { SmartAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace with your actual private key ‚Äî keep this secure!
const PRIVATE_KEY = "0xabc123...";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(PRIVATE_KEY);

export const signer: SmartAccountSigner<typeof account> = {
  signerType: "local-private-key",
  inner: account,

  getAddress: async () => account.address,

  signMessage: async (message) => {
    return account.signMessage({ message });
  },

  signTypedData: async (typedData) => {
    return account.signTypedData(typedData);
  },
};
```

## Bring in Your EOA as a Pure EOA (Using our pre-built UI Components)

Easily log in into your existing EOAs using popular wallet providers like **MetaMask**, **Rabby**, **Phantom**, and more. Note: You will not have access to Account Abstraction features here; this external EOA will be purely used as an EOA.

Our SDK supports external wallet connection out of the box, so you can seamlessly support both Web2 users with social login and Web3 users who want to bring their own EOAs.We support enabling users to bring their existing EOA in 2 ways:

1. **Automatically detect and display all wallet extensions available in the user's browser.** (_Note: if the user has no wallet extensions installed, nothing will be displayed_)
2. **WalletConnect for all other EOAs**

With Account Kit, users can still connect to their existing wallets without sacrificing compatibility or convenience.

Our hooks will handle checking if the connected wallet is a smart wallet or an existing EOA.
Transactions can be signed and sent in the same way, but external EOA wallets don't have access to Account Abstraction benefits such as gas abstraction, batching, etc.
These EOAs will simply function as EOAs.

In order to access these external wallet providers, just make sure to include configure `type: "external_wallets"` in your config:

```ts twoslash [src/config.ts]
// @noErrors
import { createConfig, cookieStorage } from "@account-kit/react";
import { alchemy, sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    // alchemy config
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your_api_key" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - setup your app and embedded account config in the alchemy dashboard (https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts)
    chain: sepolia, // TODO: specify your preferred chain here and update imports from @account-kit/infra
    ssr: true, // Defers hydration of the account state to the client after the initial mount solving any inconsistencies between server and client state (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr)
    storage: cookieStorage, // persist the account state using cookies (read more here: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state)
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
    // optional config to override default session manager config
    sessionConfig: {
      expirationTimeMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 60 minutes (default is 15 min)
    },
  },
  {
    // authentication ui config - your customizations here
    auth: {
      sections: [
        [{ type: "email" }],
        [
          { type: "passkey" },
          { type: "social", authProviderId: "google", mode: "popup" },
          { type: "social", authProviderId: "facebook", mode: "popup" },
        ],
        [
          {
            type: "external_wallets",
            walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
          },
        ],
      ],
      addPasskeyOnSignup: true,
      showSignInText: true,
    },
  },
);
```

In order to access other providers via `WalletConnect`, **also** add `walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" }` to your config:

```ts twoslash [src/config.ts]
// @noErrors
[
  {
    type: "external_wallets",
    walletConnect: { projectId: "your-project-id" },
  },
];
```

## Bring in Your EOA as a Pure EOA (Using Custom UI)

If you need complete control over the user experience, you can customize your EOA login:

For example, using [useConnect](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useConnect)

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
import { useConnect } from "@account-kit/react";

const { connectors, connect } = useConnect({
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    console.log("Connected!", data);
  },
  onError: (err) => {
    console.error("Connection failed", err);
  },
});

return (
  <div>
    {connectors.map((connector) => (
      <button key={connector.id} onClick={() => connect({ connector })}>
        Connect with {connector.name}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```
