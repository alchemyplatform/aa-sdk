Email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and requests a verification code
2. The user enters the 6-digit code they receive in their inbox to complete authentication

You can implement Email OTP authentication in two ways:

- [Pre-built UI Components](#pre-built-ui-components) - Quick implementation with minimal code
- [Custom UI](#custom-ui) - Complete control over the user experience

## Pre-built UI Components

Account Kit provides pre-built UI components that handle the entire Email OTP authentication flow with minimal code.

### Step 1: Add Authentication Components to Your Page

Before configuring your authentication, first add one of the pre-built components to your application:

<Markdown src="../shared/modal-auth-example.mdx" />

Or:

<Markdown src="../shared/embedded-auth-example.mdx" />

### Step 2: Configure Email OTP in UI Components

After adding the components, configure the Email OTP authentication in your application config:

To customize the Email OTP authentication experience in your pre-built components, configure the UI as follows:

```tsx twoslash
import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
  auth: {
    sections: [
      [
        {
          type: "email",
          emailMode: "otp",

          // Optional customizations:
          buttonLabel: "Continue with Email",
          placeholder: "Enter your email address",
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
};

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "your-api-key" }),
    chain: sepolia,
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

Email OTP configuration accepts the following options:

```ts twoslash
type EmailAuthType = {
  type: "email";
  emailMode: "otp";
  // hides the continue button
  hideButton?: boolean;
  // changes the button label
  buttonLabel?: string;
  // changes the placeholder text in the input
  placeholder?: string;
};
```

You can find the full type definition in the [Account Kit source code](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/components/auth/types.ts).

For more details on UI component customization, see the [UI Components](/wallets/react/ui-components) documentation.

## Custom UI

If you need complete control over the user experience, you can implement your own custom UI for Email OTP authentication using Account Kit hooks.

### Step 1: Send the OTP

First, prompt your user for their email address and send an OTP:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits their email
const handleSendCode = (email: string) => {
  authenticate(
    {
      type: "email",
      emailMode: "otp",
      email,
    },
    {
      onSuccess: () => {
        // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email OTP + optional MFA).
        // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        // Handle error
      },
    }
  );
};
```

### Step 2: Show OTP Input on Status Change

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook and `AlchemySignerStatus` enum to react to status changes:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";
import { AlchemySignerStatus } from "@account-kit/signer";

const TrackStatus = () => {
  const { status } = useSignerStatus();

  return (
    <>
      {status === AlchemySignerStatus.AWAITING_EMAIL_AUTH && (
        <div>Prompt the user to enter the OTP code</div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

### Step 3: Verify the OTP

Once the user receives the code, they'll enter it in your application:

```tsx twoslash
import { useAuthenticate } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { authenticate } = useAuthenticate();

// When the user submits the OTP code
const handleVerifyCode = (otpCode: string) => {
  authenticate(
    {
      type: "otp",
      otpCode,
    },
    {
      onSuccess: () => {
        // onSuccess only fires once the entire flow is done (email OTP + optional MFA).
        // It still runs even if the final step completes in another tab/window.
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        // Handle invalid code error
      },
    }
  );
};
```

### Step 4: Check authentication status

Use the `useSignerStatus` hook to determine if the user is authenticated:

```tsx twoslash
import { useSignerStatus } from "@account-kit/react";

// Inside your component
const { isConnected } = useSignerStatus();

// You can use isConnected to conditionally render UI
```

## Next Steps

### Add Authenticator App (TOTP) Verification (Optional)

If youâ€™d like to add a **second security step** to Email OTP, you can enable [Multi-Factor Authentication](/wallets/react/mfa/setup-mfa). This prompts users for a **6-digit TOTP code** from their authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy) after they verify their email.
