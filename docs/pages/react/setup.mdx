## Prerequisites

To use Smart Wallets, you need the following:

1. An Alchemy **API Key** from [the dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup). 

> Follow the steps [here](/docs/create-an-api-key) to create an app and acquire an API key.

2. A **`configuration`** created in the [`Smart Wallets` dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) to enable login methods. Make sure to enable this configuration on your app from step 1. 

3. A **policy ID** to sponsor gas. Create a policy in your [gas manager dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration) to set rules for sponsorship. Make sure to enable the policy on the app you created in step 1.
