## Prerequisites

In order to use Alchemy Smart Wallets, you need the following:

1. An Alchemy **API Key** from [the dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup). 

> Follow the steps [here](/docs/create-an-api-key) to create an app and acquire an API key.

2. A **`configuration`** created in the [`Smart Wallets` dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) to enable login methods. Make sure to enable this configuration on your app from step 1. 

3. If you want to use account abstraction features (ie. sponsoring user transactions), you will need a **paymaster policy ID**. 

You can set up your own paymaster policy in the [Gas Manager Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration).
