## Prerequisites

In order to use Alchemy Smart Wallets, you need the following:

1. An Alchemy **API Key** from [the dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup). 

> Follow the steps [here](/docs/create-an-api-key) to create an app and acquire an API key.

2. An active **`Configuration`** created in the [`Smart Wallets` tab](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) of the Alchemy Dashboard.

3. If you want to use account abstraction features (ie. sponsoring user transactions), you will need a **paymaster policy ID**. 

You can set up your own paymaster policy in the [Gas Manager Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration).
