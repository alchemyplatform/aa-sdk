Account Kit supports multi-chain apps, allowing you to build applications that interact with multiple blockchains. This guide will show you how to set up your app to work with multiple chains.

## Update your config

In order to support multiple chains in your app, the first thing you need to do is update your `createConfig` call to include the chains you want to support.

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// @noErrors
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, mainnet } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig({
  apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
  // this is the default chain
  chain: sepolia,
  chains: [
    {
      chain: mainnet, // optional: you can specify a policy ID for this chain, if you want to sponsor gas
      policyId: "MAINNET_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    },
    {
      chain: sepolia,
      // optional: you can specify a policy ID for this chain, if you want to sponsor gas
      policyId: "SEPOLIA_GAS_MANAGER_POLICY_ID",
    },
  ],
});
```

## Change chains

Once your app is configured to use multiple chains, you can switch between them at any time using the [`useChain`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useChain) hook.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useChain } from "@account-kit/react";
import { mainnet, sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { chain, setChain } = useChain();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current chain: {chain.name}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setChain({ chain: mainnet })}>
        Switch to Mainnet
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setChain({ chain: sepolia })}>
        Switch to Sepolia
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
