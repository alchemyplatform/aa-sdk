# Getting started with authentication

Account Kit makes it really easy to authenticate your users using a number of different authentication methods. If you followed the [quickstart](/react/quickstart), then your app is already setup to authenticate users and you can skip this guide!

## Implementation Options

For each authentication method, you have two implementation options:

1. [**Pre-built UI Components**](/react/ui-components) - Ready-to-use components that handle the entire authentication flow with minimal code and customizable styling.

2. [**Custom UI with React Hooks**](/react/react-hooks) - Build your own UI components using our React hooks for complete control over the user experience.

## Authentication Methods

Account Kit supports several authentication methods:

<AuthenticationMethods />

# Setup

If you haven't followed the [quickstart guide](/react/quickstart), make sure to set up the following first:

<Snippet />

...and paste the API key into your app's `config.ts`

```ts twoslash config.ts
import { AlchemyAccountsUIConfig, createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia, alchemy } from "@account-kit/infra";

// Define UI configuration for authentication components
// See individual login method pages for detailed configuration options
const uiConfig: AlchemyAccountsUIConfig = {
  auth: {
    sections: [
      [
        // Example: Email OTP authentication
        {
          type: "email",
          emailMode: "otp",
        },
        // You can add more authentication methods here
        // See login method pages for available options
      ],
    ],
  },
};

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    transport: alchemy({ apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY" }), // TODO: add your Alchemy API key - https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts
    chain: sepolia,
    ssr: true, // more about ssr: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr
    enablePopupOauth: true, // must be set to "true" if you plan on using popup rather than redirect in the social login flow
    // For more about persisting state with cookies, see: https://accountkit.alchemy.com/react/ssr#persisting-the-account-state
    // storage: cookieStorage,
  },
  uiConfig
);
```

# What's next?

Now you can choose which authentication methods you want to implement and how you want to implement them:

1. [Using our Pre-built UI components](/react/ui-components) to handle the entire authentication flow with minimal code.
2. [Using our React hooks](/react/react-hooks) to build your own custom UI for complete control.

Each authentication method has dedicated documentation for both implementation approaches.
