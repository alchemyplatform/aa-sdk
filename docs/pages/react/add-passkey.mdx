You may have noticed in the [Demo App](https://demo.alchemy.com/) that you can allow a user to log in with an existing passkey, but there's no way to sign-up with a passkey. This guide will outline
how to add a passkey to a user's account after they've signed up.

If you're not sure how to authenticate your users, see [this guide](/wallets/react/getting-started).

## Add a passkey on sign up

The easiest way to add a passkey to users is right when they signup! This can be done by updating your `ui` config in the `createConfig` call to enable the UI components to prompt the user for a passkey.

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// @noErrors
import { createConfig } from "@account-kit/react";
import { sepolia } from "@account-kit/infra";

export const config = createConfig(
  {
    chain: sepolia,
    apiKey: "ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
  },
  {
    illustrationStyle: "outline",
    auth: {
      sections: [[{ type: "email" }], [{ type: "passkey" }]],
      addPasskeyOnSignup: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  }
);
```

Now, when a user signs up, they will be prompted to create a passkey.

## Add a passkey later

With the above config, the user will only be prompted when they first create their account in your app. If you want to add the ability to add a passkey elsewhere in your app, for example in a settings page, you can use the [`useAddPasskey`](/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAddPasskey) hook.

<Warning>
  This hook requires that the user already be authenticated or else it will
  throw an error!
</Warning>

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useAddPasskey } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { addPasskey, isAddingPasskey } = useAddPasskey();

  return (
    <button
      disabled={isAddingPasskey}
      onClick={() => {
        addPasskey();
      }}
    >
      Add Passkey
    </button>
  );
}
```
