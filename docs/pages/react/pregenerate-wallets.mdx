description: Learn how to pre-generate Smart Wallet addresses for your users with nothing more than an email address.
slug: wallets/react/pregenerate-wallets
---

When you already know who your users are (for example you collected their email during wait-list signup) you might want to **create wallet addresses ahead of time** so you can airdrop assets or seed balances _before_ they ever open your app.

With Alchemy you can do this entirely from your server using the **Signer API** – no UI, hooks, or user interaction required.

<Info>
  This guide focuses on using the [`Create Wallet`
  endpoint](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/api/smart-wallets/signer-api-endpoints/signer-api-endpoints/create-account)
  ( `POST /signer/v1/signup` ). All you need to supply is the user's email; the
  response contains **both an EVM address** and **a Solana address** that you
  can fund immediately.
</Info>

## 1. Get an API key

Grab an **API Key** from the Alchemy dashboard and store it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ALCHEMY_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## 2. Get the owner of the smart account

Use whichever call style fits your environment – they all hit the same endpoint with the same JSON body.

## 3. Response fields

| Field           | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `address`       | The **signer (EOA)** address that will **own** your user's smart account (this is _not_ the smart account itself). |
| `solanaAddress` | The **Solana** wallet address associated with the same user.                                                       |
| `orgId`         | Your organisation ID – useful if you operate multiple orgs.                                                        |

<Tip>
  The address you receive here is the **owner key**. Your user's Smart Contract
  Account (ModularAccountV2) will be deployed at a different address – but we
  can deterministically calculate it ahead of time using
  `predictModularAccountV2Address`.
</Tip>

## 4. Get the smart account address

The `@account-kit/smart-contracts` package exports a utility that mirrors the
CREATE2 logic used by the MAv2 factory. By passing the signer address you just
generated, you can know the **counter-factual** (future) address of the smart
account before it is even deployed.

```ts twoslash
import { predictModularAccountV2Address } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";

// Factory & implementation addresses vary by chain – you can grab them from
// the "Deployed addresses" page in the docs or import helpers such as
// `getDefaultModularAccountV2FactoryAddress`.

const mav2FactoryAddress = "0x00000000000017c61b5bEe81050EC8eFc9c6fecd";
const implementationAddress = "0x000000000000c5A9089039570Dd36455b5C07383";

const smartAccountAddress = predictModularAccountV2Address({
  factoryAddress,
  implementationAddress,
  salt: 0n, // use 0 unless you have a custom salt scheme
  type: "SMA",
  ownerAddress: address, // signer address from Step 2
});

console.log({ smartAccountAddress });
```

Now you have **both** the owner key (`address`) and the eventual smart account
address (`smartAccountAddress`). When the user finally authenticates, their
smart account will be deployed at exactly this counter-factual address.
