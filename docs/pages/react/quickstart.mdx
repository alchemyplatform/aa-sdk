> You can also follow the [Quickstart in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/quickstart).

## 1. Clone template repo

```bash
npx create-next-app my-smart-wallets-app -e https://github.com/alchemyplatform/smart-wallets-quickstart
cd my-smart-wallets-app
```

## 2. Set up environment

Once you have your project cloned down and you are in the `my-smart-wallets-app` level in your terminal, go to your project's root, create a `.env` file and copy-paste the following into it:

```shell
# Paste this in your .env file
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=YOUR_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID
```

Remember: you must create a [`Configuration`](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) and a [`Paymaster Policy`](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/sponsor-gas/configuration) if you want to use Smart Wallets.

<Warning>
  Both the `Configuration` and the `Policy ID` must be linked to the application
  behind your API Key!
</Warning>

## 3. Run app

In your terminal, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your `localhost:3000` should now display the following:

## 4. Log in and view the app

You can use a service like [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/) to test logins with throwaway email accounts.

> Note: Social login will not work just yet!

Once you use an email, you will receive a 6-digit authentication code. Copy-paste it into the following screen:

Once you have signed in, you can mint your own NFT! ðŸŽ‰
