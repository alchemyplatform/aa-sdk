We built a specialized [Quickstart component in the Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/quickstart). Let's use that to set up our own app!

<Tip>
  Check out what you can build using our [Demo App](https://demo.alchemy.com/).
</Tip>

## 1. Use template repo

Go to https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/quickstart to get started.

![Alchemy Dashboard Smart Wallets Quickstart](https://alchemyapi-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755748422/docs/Screenshot_2025-08-20_at_8.53.37_PM_ydyhrj.png)

Copy-paste the following from `Step 1` in the Dashboard into your terminal:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash
npx create-next-app my-smart-wallets-app -e https://github.com/alchemyplatform/smart-wallets-quickstart
cd my-smart-wallets-app
```
</CodeBlocks>

## 2. Set up environment

Once you have your project cloned down and you are in the `my-smart-wallets-app` level in your terminal, go to your project's root, create a `.env` file and copy-paste the following into it:

<CodeBlocks>
```shell
# Paste this in your .env file
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=YOUR_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID
```
</CodeBlocks>

Remember: you must create a [`Configuration`](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) and a [`Paymaster Policy`](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration) if you want to use Alchemy Smart Wallets.

<Warning>
  Both the `Configuration` and the `Policy ID` must be linked to the application behind your Alchemy API Key!
</Warning>

## 3. Run app

In your terminal, run:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash
npm run dev
```
</CodeBlocks>

Your `localhost:3000` should now display the following:

## 4. Log in and view the app

You can use a service like [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/) to test logins with throwaway email accounts.

> Note: Social login will not work just yet!

Once you use an email, you will receive a 6-digit authentication code. Copy-paste it into the following screen:

Once you have signed in, you can mint your own NFT! ðŸŽ‰
