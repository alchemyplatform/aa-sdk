## Not sure which to choose?

**Choose NextJS Template if:**

- You're building a new project from scratch
- You want the fastest way to see embedded wallets in action
- You're okay with a pre-built setup and want to customize later

**Choose React Integration if:**

- You have an existing React or NextJS application
- You need to integrate embedded wallets into your current codebase
- You want more control over the configuration from the start
