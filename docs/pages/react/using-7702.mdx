## What is EIP-7702?

[EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) is live as part of the Ethereum Pectra hardfork on testnet and mainnet! Specifically, EIP-7702 enables Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to use smart account features.

This upgrade marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's journey toward smart accounts, a breakthrough designed to make onchain experiences smoother, smarter, and more accessible. EIP-7702 was designed to complement existing smart account standards and make it easier for smart account features to reach users.

- EIP-7702 enables EOAs to delegate control to smart accounts that can execute code directly from their addresses
- Existing EOAs can enable smart account features without creating a new address and transferring assets
- For users, it will enable web2-like features, including account recovery and passkey sign-in for easier authentication, and web3 benefits like gas-sponsored transaction fees and paying for gas in any token, not just ETH

## When to use EIP-7702?

**For developers with existing users and embedded wallets**

Upgrade your existing embedded EOA users to smart accounts to enable features like batching and gas sponsorship. Smart Wallets makes this upgrade easy with compatible smart accounts and infrastructure. Follow [this guide](/wallets/smart-contracts/modular-account-v2/using-7702).

**For developers who have not deployed their app**

While smart accounts and EIP-7702 both enable smart account features, they serve different needs. You can either:

- **(Recommended)** Use smart accounts from the start to leverage the fullest smart account features such as maximum account programability, extensive transaction customization, and established tooling: get started [here](/wallets/react/how-to-set-up-smart-account-client)
- Use EIP-7702 smart EOAs: keep reading this guide

[Explore here](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/eip-7702-ethereum-pectra-hardfork#adoption-and-security-considerations-for-application-developers) to decide what's best for you.

## How to ship smart EOAs

In this example, you will upgrade a **new** embedded EOA to a smart account ([Modular Account v2](/wallets/smart-contracts/modular-account-v2/overview)) and send a gasless transaction from the account.

The following sets up a Smart Account Client using the EIP-7702 supported version of a Modular Account v2. Make sure to first go through the [authentication setup](/wallets/react/getting-started) to set up authentication.

Currently, this is supported on Ethereum Mainnet and Sepolia. Make sure to enable a supported chain on the app you are using and set it as the chain in your authentication config.

```tsx twoslash
import { useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

const { client, address, isLoadingClient } = useSmartAccountClient({
  type: "ModularAccountV2",
  accountParams: {
    mode: "7702",
  },
});
```

### 2. Send a sponsored transaction

Now that you have a smart account client with an EIP-7702 supported smart account, you can leverage all of the easy-to-use React hooks to take action on the account. Smart Wallets will handle all of the complexity of delegating your EOA to the smart account and handling the special signature types.

Continue on to [sending transactions](/wallets/transactions/send/send-user-operations) and [sponsoring gas](/wallets/transactions/sponsor-gas/sponsor-gas-evm).

## When can I use it?

Today! EIP-7702 is live on Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia, and more. Smart Wallets will support EIP-7702 integration on more chains as they roll out EIP-7702 support.

Check out the [UI Demo](https://demo.alchemy.com) to see a live preview of these features in action!
