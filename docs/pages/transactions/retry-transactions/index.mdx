Replace stuck transactions by re-preparing and sending calls again without waiting, easily.

Key use cases:

- Replace transactions stuck due to low gas prices
- Speed up pending transactions by increasing gas fees
- Override transactions that have been pending for too long
- Cancel stuck transactions by replacing with a no-op

## The Retry flow

1. Send initial transaction
2. Monitor transaction status
3. If stuck/pending too long, re-prepare the same call
4. Send with higher gas to replace the stuck transaction
5. Original transaction gets dropped from mempool

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Alchemy API Key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- A [Gas Manager](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create) policy
- A signer to own the account and sign messages
