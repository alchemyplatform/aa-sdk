Replace stuck transactions by re-preparing and sending calls again without waiting, easily.

Key use cases:

- Replace transactions stuck due to low gas prices
- Speed up pending transactions by increasing gas fees
- Override transactions that have been pending for too long
- Cancel stuck transactions by replacing with a no-op

## The Retry flow

1. Send the initial transaction
2. Monitor the transaction status
3. If the transaction is stuck/pending too long, re-prepare the same call
4. Send the transaction with higher gas to replace the stuck transaction
5. The original transaction gets dropped from mempool

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Alchemy API Key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- A [Gas Manager](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create) policy
- A signer to own the account and sign messages

<Info>
  If the original transaction is already being mined, the replacement
  transaction may be dropped. In this case, you won't be able to retrieve data
  using the replacement's call ID, and the original transaction will be
  included!
