title: Swaps (Alpha)
slug: wallets/transactions/swap-tokens
---

Swaps let you convert any token to any other token across blockchain networks. They're built natively into Smart Wallets and you can integrate in minutes.

Smart Wallets also allow you to add actions after the swap completes. For example, you can deposit your newly swapped tokens into a DeFi protocol.

Swaps work just like any other Smart Wallet transaction, so you can sponsor gas to do gasless swaps, or pay for gas in an ERC-20 token.

Cross-chain swaps are coming soon!

<Tip>
    Swaps are in early access. The service is production ready, however there may be changes in the future to simplify the endpoint. We will let you know if/when that happens.

# The Swap flow

## **Flow**

1. Request a swap quote
2. Sign the prepared swap calls (including any post swap action)
3. Send prepared calls
4. Wait for blockchain confirmation

## **Swap options**

When requesting a swap quote, you can specify either an amount in, or a minimum amount out.

````ts
// Mode 1: Swap exact input amount
{
  fromAmount: "0x2710";
} // Swap exactly 0.01 USDC (10000 in hex, 6 decimals)

```ts
// Mode 2: Get minimum output amount
{
  minimumToAmount: "0x5AF3107A4000";
} // Get at least 0.0001 ETH (18 decimals). We calculate how much USDC you need to spend to get at least your desired ETH amount.
````

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Alchemy API Key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- If you're sponsoring gas, then a [Gas Manager](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create) policy
- A small amount of USDC for testing (~$1 worth is enough!)
  - **Important**: You'll need to send these tokens to your smart wallet address to be able to swap!
- A signer to own the account and sign messages

<Info>
  Note that Swaps are currently only supported via the Javascript client or
  direct APIs. React is coming (very) soon!

# FAQs

## What chains are supported?

Chains supported (for now) are: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Berachain, BSC/BNB, Ink, Monad, Optimism, Polygon, Unichain and World Chain mainnets.

## Does the Swap API support cross-chain swaps?

Currently, the Swap API supports only single-chain swaps. Cross-chain swaps are coming soon!

## How do you encode values?

Values are simply passed as hexadecimal strings. The Swap API doesn't add complexity to consider decimals, so 0x01 is always the smallest amount of a given asset.
1 ETH, or DAI (18 decimals) is `0xDE0B6B3A7640000`
1 USDC (6 decimals) is `0xF4240`
This removes any ambiguity— if it’s numerical, it’s a hex.

## What is the expiry?

The expiry is an informational indicator of when you can expect to be able to process the swap request. If you’re at/near the expiry, it might be a good time to request a new quote.

## What if I’m using React?

Use the `@account-kit/react` package to access a `smartWalletClient`. This package automatically uses the Signer for user authentication & signing. [Check out the docs for getting started with React to learn more](/wallets/react/quickstart).
