title: Pay Gas With Any Token

Gas fees paid in the native token can feel foreign to users that primarily hold stablecoins or your app's own token. With smart wallets, you can allow your users to pay for gas with any ERC-20 token, streamlining the user experience.

<Tip>
  *How it works:* To enable this capability, create a Gas Manager policy. When a
  user pays for gas with an ERC-20 token, the gas is fronted using the network's
  native gas token and the ERC-20 tokens are transferred from the user's wallet
  to a wallet you control. The equivalent USD amount and the admin fee are then
  added to your monthly invoice.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

- Smart Wallets already installed and configured in your project.
- An Alchemy API key.

See the [setup page](/docs/wallets/pages/react/setup.mdx) for instructions.

## Create a Gas Manager Policy

To enable your users to pay gas using an ERC-20 token, create a "Pay gas with any token" policy via the [Gas Manager dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create). You can customize the policy with the following:

- Receiving address: **specify** an address you own to receive the users' ERC20 tokens spent on gas. The token transfer to this address happens automatically at transaction time and is orchestrated by the paymaster contract.
- Tokens: **select** which tokens users should be able to pay gas with. Learn more [here](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/gas-manager-faqs).
- ERC-20 transfer mode: choose when the user's token payment occurs. See more details on the modes [below](#erc-20-transfer-modes)
  - [Recommended] Post-Operation: No upfront allowance is required. The user signs an approval inside the same calls batch, and the paymaster pulls the token after the operation has executed. If that post-operation transfer fails, the entire batch is reverted and you (the developer) pay the gas fee.
  - Pre-Operation: The paymaster must have an allowance prior to the operation. This can be done either through a prior call to `approve()` or by using an [ERC-7597 Permit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7597) signature. If the required allowance isn't in place when the user operation is submitted, it will be rejected.
- Sponsorship expiry period: the period for which the signature and ERC-20 exchange rate remain valid once generated.

Now you have a policy created with a policy id you can use to enable gas payments with ERC-20 tokens.

### ERC-20 Gas Payment Modes

Post-Operation mode is recommended in most cases. It:

- Is the most gas efficient as it only requires a single transfer.
- Works with all ERC-20 tokens.
- Only ever requires a single signature from the user.

However, because tokens are deducted after execution, it is possible that you (the sponsoring developer) may be required to pay for gas without receiving sufficient ERC-20 payment.
Ensure that the user has enough token left over to pay for gas after the operation, else you won't receive payment from the user for gas and the operation will revert.
If the operation performed will result in a static amount of the userâ€™s ERC-20 token balance after execution and you can account for this before submitting the operation, use PostOp mode.

Examples of static amounts:

- Payments, purchases, and deposits
- Operations unrelated to the ERC-20 token

Examples of dynamic amounts:

- Swaps of the ERC-20 payment token

If you are sponsoring operations that result in dynamic amounts of the ERC-20 token left over, consider using PreOp mode.

## Use With Wallet APIs

To pay gas with any token using Wallet APIs, use the `erc20` field on the `paymasterService` capability.
There, you can configure the token to be used for the particular request and control auto-injecting approvals when needed.

For a full list of settings on the `paymasterService` capability, see the [`wallet_prepareCalls` API reference](/docs/wallets/api/smart-wallets/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-prepare-calls).

### Estimating Gas Payments

To show your users the gas cost in their chosen gas token prior to signing and sending their request,
use the `prepareCalls` hook/action/api over the `sendCalls` version
as `sendCalls` doesn't surface the fee payment information during sign and send.

The return type of `prepareCalls` contains a `feePayment` field containing fee information. This information can be displayed to the user prior to signing the operation. For example:

```
  "feePayment": {
    "sponsored": false,
    "tokenAddress": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    "maxAmount": "0x1d33"
  }
```

Calling `prepareCalls` using the ERC-20 paymaster capability counts against your policy's pending total. If you intend on making many
calls to surface the best price, set the `onlyEstimation` parameter for estimation, and then remove only when the user intends to sign the result.

<Warning>
  Requests to `prepareCalls` count against your policy's pending total. Use
  `onlyEstimation` if the intention is to query for the fee and not to sign the
  operation. Note that `onlyEstimation` does not work with the `sendCalls`
  requests and must be used with `prepareCalls`.
</Warning>

### Auto-Injected Approvals

The Wallet APIs can be configured to automatically inject the required approvals into the operation when needed. The settings for this depend on the mode being used.

#### Post-Operation Mode

In post-operation mode, you can set the paymaster service capability to automatically inject approvals to the paymaster contract using the `erc20.postOp.autoApprove` field.
The approval will be batched with the provided calls to ensure it's in place before the transfer to the paymaster during post-operation.
To save gas, the approval is only injected if the sender's existing allowance on the paymaster contract is less than the `below` parameter. The injected approval will be set to
the `amount` parameter.

Set `below` high enough to reasonably cover the gas cost for your most expensive operations. Set `amount` to a value
you feel comfortable maintaining as an allowance on the paymaster contract. Setting a large `amount` is not recommended for security purposes.

#### Pre-Operation Mode

<Note>
  This is an advanced feature. Use Post-Operation Mode for most use cases.
</Note>

In pre-operation mode, you can set the paymaster service capability to automatically return a request for a Permit signature using the `erc20.preOp.autoPermit` field.
This permit will allow an allowance to be set on the paymaster contract from the sender prior to any token transfers needed during pre operation.

To be eligible for auto-injected permits, the ERC-20 gas token must:

1. Be [ERC-7597](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7597) compliant.
2. Expose a `version()` function.
3. Utilize the canonical `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` outlined in [ERC-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612).

If the user already has an allowance on the paymaster contract, the normal flow is used. If the user needs an
approval, the following steps inject the permit:

1. The prepare request returns a signature request for the paymaster permit.
2. The user signs the permit request and the signature request back in a second prepare request.
3. The permit signature is injected into the paymaster contract calldata, and a normal operation is returned.
4. The user proceeds as normal, signing and sending the operation.

## Usage
