title: Cross-chain swaps (Alpha)
slug: wallets/transactions/cross-chain-swap-tokens
---

Cross-chain swaps let you convert tokens across different blockchain networks in a single transaction. They're built natively into Smart Wallets and you can integrate in minutes.

Cross-chain swaps work just like any other Smart Wallet transaction, so you can sponsor gas to do gasless swaps, or pay for gas in an ERC-20 token.

<Tip>
  Cross-chain swaps are in alpha. Note that there may be changes in the future
  to simplify the endpoint/sdk. We will let you know if/when that happens.

# The Cross-chain Swap flow

## **Flow**

1. Request a cross-chain swap quote
2. Sign the prepared swap calls
3. Send prepared calls
4. Wait for cross-chain confirmation

## **Swap options**

<Info>
  **Important**: Cross-chain swaps do not support `postCalls`. You cannot batch
  additional actions after a cross-chain swap completes (for now).
</Info>

When requesting a cross-chain swap quote, you can specify either a `fromAmount` , or a `minimumToAmount`.

```tsx
// Mode 1: Swap exact input amount
{
  fromAmount: "0x2710";
} // Swap exactly 0.01 USDC (10000 in hex, 6 decimals)

// Mode 2: Get minimum output amount
{
  minimumToAmount: "0x5AF3107A4000";
} // Get at least 0.0001 ETH (18 decimals). The amount you need to spend is calculated to get at least your desired ETH amount.
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Alchemy API Key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- If you're sponsoring gas, then a [Gas Manager](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create) policy
- A small amount of tokens for testing (~$1 worth is enough!)
  - **Important**: You'll need to send these tokens to your smart wallet address to be able to swap!
- A signer to own the account and sign messages

<Info>
  Note that Cross-chain Swaps are currently supported via direct APIs and the
  SDK. React support coming soon!

# FAQs

## What chains are supported for cross-chain swaps?

Chains supported (for now) are: Arbitrum, Arbitrum Nova, Base, Berachain, Boba Network, BSC/BNB, Celo, Ethereum, Hyperliquid, Ink, Optimism, Plasma, Polygon, Shape, Soneium, Story, Unichain, World Chain, and Zora mainnets.

## Can I batch additional calls after a cross-chain swap?

No, `postCalls` are not supported for cross-chain swaps (for now). You can only perform the swap itself across chains.

## How long do cross-chain swaps take?

Cross-chain swaps typically take longer than single-chain swaps due to the need for cross-chain messaging and confirmation. The exact time depends on the source and destination chains involved in the swap.

## How do you encode values?

Values are simply passed as hexadecimal strings. The Swap API doesn't add complexity to consider decimals, so 0x01 is always the smallest amount of a given asset.
1 ETH, or DAI (18 decimals) is `0xDE0B6B3A7640000`
1 USDC (6 decimals) is `0xF4240`
This removes any ambiguity— if it's numerical, it's a hex.

## What is the expiry?

The expiry is an informational indicator of when you can expect to be able to process the swap request. If you're at/near the expiry, it might be a good time to request a new quote.

## What are the different status codes for cross-chain swaps?

Cross-chain swaps may have additional status codes beyond standard transaction statuses to reflect the cross-chain nature of the transaction. These are:

- 120: Cross-chain in progress
- 410: Cross-chain refund

## When is a CallId returned from `wallet_requestQuote_v0`?

Any time you’re requesting a cross-chain quote via `wallet_requestQuote_v0` , a `callId` is returned. This `callId` includes important data for cross-chain tracking. You can use this just like any other `callId` in `wallet_getCallsStatus`!
