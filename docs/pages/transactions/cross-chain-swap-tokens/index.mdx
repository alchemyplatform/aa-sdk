title: Cross-chain swaps (Alpha)
slug: wallets/transactions/cross-chain-swap-tokens
---

Cross-chain swaps let you convert tokens across different blockchain networks in a single transaction. They're built natively into Smart Wallets and you can integrate in minutes.

Cross-chain swaps work just like any other Smart Wallet transaction, so you can sponsor gas to do gasless swaps, or pay for gas in an ERC-20 token.

<Tip>
  Cross-chain swaps are in alpha. Note that there may be changes in the future
  to simplify the endpoint/sdk. We will let you know if/when that happens.
</Tip>

# The Cross-chain Swap flow

## **Flow**

1. Request a cross-chain swap quote
2. Sign the prepared swap calls
3. Send prepared calls
4. Wait for cross-chain confirmation

## **Swap options**

<Info>
  **Important**: Cross-chain swaps do not support `postCalls`. You cannot batch
  additional actions after a cross-chain swap completes (for now).
</Info>

When requesting a cross-chain swap quote, you can specify either a `fromAmount` , or a `minimumToAmount`.

```tsx
// Mode 1: Swap exact input amount
{
  fromAmount: "0x2710";
} // Swap exactly 0.01 USDC (10000 in hex, 6 decimals)

// Mode 2: Get minimum output amount
{
  minimumToAmount: "0x5AF3107A4000";
} // Get at least 0.0001 ETH (18 decimals). The amount you need to spend is calculated to get at least your desired ETH amount.
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Alchemy API Key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- If you're sponsoring gas, then a [Gas Manager](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create) policy
- A small amount of tokens for testing (~$1 worth is enough!)
  - **Important**: You'll need to send these tokens to your smart wallet address to be able to swap!
- A signer to own the account and sign messages

<Info>
  Note that Cross-chain Swaps are currently supported via direct APIs and the
  SDK. React support coming soon!

# Tracking a cross-chain swap

After sending your cross-chain swap, you can track its progress using the `wallet_getCrossChainStatus_v0` endpoint. This endpoint provides detailed status information for both the origin and destination transactions.

<Info>
  **Note**: The `wallet_getCrossChainStatus_v0` endpoint is currently available
  via API only. SDK support coming soon.
</Info>

## Use the status endpoint

Pass the `callId` from your swap request to check the current status:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2/{API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "wallet_getCrossChainStatus_v0",
    "params": [
      "{CALL_ID}"
    ],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Response format

The response type depends on whether your transaction is same-chain or cross-chain.

### Cross-chain response

For cross-chain swaps, the response includes both origin and destination transaction details:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "type": "cross-chain",
    "id": "0x...",
    "status": 120,
    "originTransaction": {
      "chainId": "0xa4b1",
      "status": 200,
      "receipt": {
        "status": "0x1",
        "blockHash": "0x...",
        "blockNumber": "0x...",
        "gasUsed": "0x...",
        "transactionHash": "0x...",
        "logs": []
      }
    },
    "destinationTransaction": {
      "chainId": "0x1",
      "status": 100
    }
  }
}
```

### Same-chain response

For same-chain transactions, the response includes origin transaction details only:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "type": "same-chain",
    "id": "0x...",
    "status": 200,
    "originTransaction": {
      "chainId": "0x1",
      "status": 200,
      "receipt": {
        "status": "0x1",
        "blockHash": "0x...",
        "blockNumber": "0x...",
        "gasUsed": "0x...",
        "transactionHash": "0x...",
        "logs": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Status codes

The `status` field indicates the current state of your transaction:

| Code | Status                               | Description                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100  | Pending                              | Transaction received but not confirmed onchain                |
| 110  | Preconfirmed                         | Transaction preconfirmed onchain                              |
| 115  | Preconfirmed Onchain Failure         | Transaction reverted completely in preconfirmation            |
| 116  | Preconfirmed Partial Onchain Failure | Transaction reverted partially in preconfirmation             |
| 120  | Cross-Chain In Progress              | Origin transaction confirmed, destination transaction pending |
| 200  | Confirmed                            | Transaction confirmed onchain without reverts                 |
| 400  | Offchain Failure                     | Transaction failed offchain and will not be retried           |
| 410  | Cross-Chain Refunded                 | Cross-chain transaction failed and was refunded               |
| 500  | Onchain Failure                      | Transaction reverted completely onchain                       |
| 600  | Partial Onchain Failure              | Transaction reverted partially onchain                        |

## Get transaction hashes

To access transaction hashes from the response:

- **Origin transaction hash**: `result.originTransaction.receipt.transactionHash`
- **Destination transaction hash**: `result.destinationTransaction.receipt.transactionHash` (when available)

# FAQs

## What chains are supported for cross-chain swaps?

Chains supported (for now) are: Arbitrum, Arbitrum Nova, Base, Berachain, Boba Network, BSC/BNB, Celo, Ethereum, Hyperliquid, Ink, Optimism, Plasma, Polygon, Shape, Soneium, Story, Unichain, World Chain, and Zora mainnets.

## Can I batch additional calls after a cross-chain swap?

No, `postCalls` are not supported for cross-chain swaps (for now). You can only perform the swap itself across chains.

## How long do cross-chain swaps take?

Cross-chain swaps typically take longer than single-chain swaps due to the need for cross-chain messaging and confirmation. The exact time depends on the source and destination chains involved in the swap.

## How do you encode values?

Values are simply passed as hexadecimal strings. The Swap API doesn't add complexity to consider decimals, so 0x01 is always the smallest amount of a given asset.
1 ETH, or DAI (18 decimals) is `0xDE0B6B3A7640000`
1 USDC (6 decimals) is `0xF4240`
This removes any ambiguity— if it's numerical, it's a hex.

## What is the expiry?

The expiry is an informational indicator of when you can expect to be able to process the swap request. If you're at/near the expiry, it might be a good time to request a new quote.

## What are the different status codes for cross-chain swaps?

Cross-chain swaps may have additional status codes beyond standard transaction statuses to reflect the cross-chain nature of the transaction. These are:

- 120: Cross-chain in progress
- 410: Cross-chain refund

## When is a CallId returned from `wallet_requestQuote_v0`?

Any time you’re requesting a cross-chain quote via `wallet_requestQuote_v0` , a `callId` is returned. This `callId` includes important data for cross-chain tracking. You can use this just like any other `callId` in `wallet_getCallsStatus`!
