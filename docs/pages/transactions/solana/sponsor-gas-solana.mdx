Fees and rent are a significant barrier to entry for new users of your app. Sponsor fees and rent to enable users to transact without holding SOL.

- Works with any Solana wallet. [Check out Solana Smart Wallets](/wallets/react/solana-wallets/get-started)
- No need to manage SOL, we sponsor fees & rent and put it on your bill

## How it works

When you request gas sponsorship for a transaction using a configured policy, the policy engine will determine if that transaction is eligible for sponsorship. If eligible, when the user sends the transaction the Gas Manager will pay for the fees & rent upfront. The Gas Manager will make a note of the sponsored cost and add it to your monthly bill.

- Fees: the cost of executing transactions
- Rent: the minimum payment to store data onchain
  - Rent sponsorship is supported for `createAccount`, `createAssociatedTokenAccount`, and any other program that supports adding a `feePayer`. If you need support for custom programs, contact [wallets@alchemy.com](mailto:wallets@alchemy.com).

## Prerequisites

- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- Smart Wallets for Solana [set up](/react/solana-wallets/get-started) in your project if you want to enable sign up/login for creation of wallets
- A sponsorship policy to cover fees and/or rent: [create a policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create/)

    ## Global sponsorship

    To apply a sponsorship policy to all transactions sent by the Solana wallet provider, you can configure fee and rent sponsorship by passing a `policyId` into your Solana config. Replace the API key and Policy Id with your keys from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration). This setup applies sponsorship to all Solana transactions sent from wallets created with this configuration (e.g. this will be applied to usage of the `useSolana…` hooks).

    ### Per transaction sponsorship

    Alternatively, to apply sponsorship conditionally for each transaction, you can pass a `policyId` to the `useSolanaTransaction` hook.

    Congrats! You’re now creating smart wallets on Solana with social login and sending sponsored transactions to create a zero-friction experience from sign-up to transaction.

    ### Prepare a Serialized Solana Transaction

    Here’s an example of creating a serialized transfer transaction using javascript:
    <Markdown src="api-prepare.mdx" />

    ### Request sponsorship for the Serialized Transaction

    To sponsor fees and rent on Solana, 1) the `payerKey` field of the transaction needs to be set to the feePayer wallet that will pay for the gas, 2) the feePayer wallet needs to sign the transaction.

    You can get the `feePayer` address and the feePayer signature through [`alchemy_requestFeePayer`](/reference/alchemy-requestfeepayer) using your gas policy id and the serialized transaction. The Gas Manager will update the `feePayer` and add the signature to the `serializedTransaction` if and only the transaction satisfies the rules defined in your policy.
