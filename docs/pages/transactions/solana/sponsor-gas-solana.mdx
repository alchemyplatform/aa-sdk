Let users send gasless transactions on Solana by sponsoring transaction fees and rent with Smart Wallets. This removes a major barrier to entry for new users of your app and the need for them to hold any SOL.

## How it works

Once you've [created](/react/solana-wallets/get-started) a smart wallet on Solana, you can define what transactions you would like to sponsor using a gas manager policy and start sponsoring Solana fees. When a transaction meets the policy, fees and rent are fronted in SOL by Alchemy's fee payer so the user doesn’t need SOL. The equivalent USD amount and the admin fee are then added to your monthly invoice.

- Fees: the cost of executing transactions
- Rent: the minimum payment to store data onchain
  - Rent sponsorship is supported for `createAccount` and `createAssociatedTokenAccount`. If you need support for custom programs, contact [wallets@alchemy.com](mailto:wallets@alchemy.com).

## Prerequisites

- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- Smart Wallets for Solana [set up](/react/solana-wallets/get-started) in your project if you want to enable sign up/login for creation of wallets
- A sponsorship policy to cover fees and/or rent: [create a policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create/)

    ## Global sponsorship

    To apply a sponsorship policy to all transactions sent by the Solana wallet provider, you can configure fee and rent sponsorship by passing a `policyId` into your Solana config. Replace the API key and Policy Id with your keys from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration). This setup applies sponsorship to all Solana transactions sent from wallets created with this configuration (e.g. this will be applied to usage of the `useSolana…` hooks).

    ### Per transaction sponsorship

    Alternatively, to apply sponsorship conditionally for each transaction, you can pass a `policyId` to the `useSolanaTransaction` hook.

    Congrats! You’re now creating smart wallets on Solana with social login and sending sponsored transactions to create a zero-friction experience from sign-up to transaction.

    ### Prepare a Serialized Solana Transaction

    Here’s an example of creating a serialized transfer transaction using javascript:
    <Markdown src="api-prepare.mdx" />

    ### Request sponsorship for the Serialized Transaction

    To sponsor fees and rent on Solana, 1) the `payerKey` field of the transaction needs to be set to the feePayer wallet that will pay for the gas, 2) the feePayer wallet needs to sign the transaction.

    You can get the `feePayer` address and the feePayer signature through [`alchemy_requestFeePayer`](/reference/alchemy-requestfeepayer) using your gas policy id and the serialized transaction. The Gas Manager will update the `feePayer` and add the signature to the `serializedTransaction` if and only the transaction satisfies the rules defined in your policy.

    ### Sign and broadcast the Transaction
