This guide will teach you how to sign EIP-712 typed data with your Smart Wallet. Typed data signing provides a more structured and secure way to sign complex data compared to plain text messages.

## Prerequisites

- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- A Smart Wallet with an associated signer

## What is typed data signing?

EIP-712 typed data signing allows users to:

- **Sign structured data** with clear type definitions
- **Improve user experience** with readable signature requests
- **Enhance security** through type safety and domain separation

Typed data follows the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard, which provides a way to encode structured data for signing.

## Typed data structure

EIP-712 typed data consists of four main components:

### Domain

The domain provides context and prevents signature reuse across different dApps:

```ts
const domain = {
  name: "Example DApp",
  version: "1",
  chainId: 1,
  verifyingContract: "0xCcCCccccCCCCcCCCCCCcCcCccCcCCCcCcccccccC",
};
```

### Types

Define the structure of your data:

```ts
const types = {
  Person: [
    { name: "name", type: "string" },
    { name: "wallet", type: "address" },
  ],
  Mail: [
    { name: "from", type: "Person" },
    { name: "to", type: "Person" },
    { name: "contents", type: "string" },
  ],
};
```

### Primary type

Specify which type is the main type being signed:

```ts
const primaryType = "Mail";
```

### Message

The actual data to sign:

```ts
const message = {
  from: {
    name: "Alice",
    wallet: "0xAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaAa",
  },
  to: {
    name: "Bob",
    wallet: "0xBbBbBbBbBbBbBbBbBbBBBBBBBBbbBbBbBbbBbBb",
  },
  contents: "Hello, Bob!",
};
```
