This guide will teach you how to sign messages using your Smart Wallet. Message signing is a key feature that allows users to authenticate and prove ownership of their wallet without spending gas.

Smart Wallets will generate signatures that can be validated using [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271). If the wallet is an undeployed smart contract account (also known as a counterfactual address), then the signature will be wrapped according to [ERC-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492).

## Prerequisites

- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- A Smart Wallet with an associated signer

## What is message signing?

Message signing allows users to:

- **Authenticate** without spending gas
- **Prove ownership** of their wallet
- **Sign arbitrary data** for offchain verification
- **Interact with dApps** that require signature-based authentication

Smart Wallets support EIP-191 message signing, which is the standard for Ethereum message signing. You may also see EIP-191 referred to as the `personal_sign` message format.
