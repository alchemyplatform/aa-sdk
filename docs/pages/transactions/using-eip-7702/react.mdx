**Prerequisites:**

- [Smart Wallets installed and configured in your project](/docs/wallets/pages/react/setup.mdx)

To use Smart Wallets in EIP-7702 mode, you must specify the mode when constructing the smart account client with `useSmartAccountClient`.
This will allow the authorized EOA to act as a smart wallet with the same address as the EOA. The `useSendCalls` hook will sign the required
delegation payload the first time that a user interacts with a new chain. This payload is then relayed on chain with the user's first transaction.

```tsx twoslash title="sendCalls.tsx" focus={4-8,17-25}
import { useSendCalls, useSmartAccountClient } from "@account-kit/react";

export default function SendCalls() {
  const { client } = useSmartAccountClient({
    accountParams: {
      mode: "7702",
    },
  });
  const { sendCallsAsync } = useSendCalls({ client });

  const handleSend = async () => {
    if (!client) {
      throw new Error("Smart account client not connected");
    }

    try {
      const { ids } = await sendCallsAsync({
        calls: [
          {
            to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            value: "0x00",
            data: "0x",
          },
        ],
      });

      console.log("Transaction sent with ID:", ids[0]);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleSend}>Click to Send</button>;
}
```
