# Gasless transactions

Gas fees are a significant barrier to entry for new users. With gas sponsorship, you can eliminate this friction by covering transaction costs for your users.

**Gas sponsorship enables:**

- **Seamless onboarding** — New users transact immediately without buying crypto
- **Web2-like UX** — Hide blockchain complexity completely
- **Higher conversion** — Remove the #1 barrier to user adoption
- **Smart cost control** — Enable flexible spending policies

<Callout intent="info">
  Existing embedded wallets can leverage gas sponsorship by using EIP-7702.
  Bring your existing embedded EOA wallets and upgrade to smart wallets to
  enable gasless transactions. Learn more about
  [EIP-7702](/wallets/transactions/using-eip-7702).
