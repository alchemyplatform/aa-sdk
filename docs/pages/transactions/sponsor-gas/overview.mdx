Gas fees are a significant barrier to entry for new users. With gas sponsorship, you can eliminate this friction by covering gas costs for your users.

## Get Started

Start sponsoring gas in minutes:

1. **Create a policy** in your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps/latest/services/gas-manager/configuration) and configure sponsorship rules
2. **Send sponsored transactions** using your policy ID

No need to manage crypto or pre-fund accounts. Alchemy fronts the gas for your users' transactions and you pay the equivalent USD amount.

Get started [here](/wallets/transactions/sponsor-gas)!
