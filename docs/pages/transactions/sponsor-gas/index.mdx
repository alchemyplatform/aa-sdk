Gas fees are a significant barrier to entry for new users of your app.
With Smart Wallets you can remove this barrier by sponsoring gas fees for transactions via the Gas Manager.

## How it works

When a user requests gas sponsorship using a configured policy, the policy engine will determine if that transaction is eligible for sponsorship.
If eligible, when the user sends the transaction the Gas Manager will pay for the gas fee upfront. The Gas Manager will make a note of the sponsored cost
and bill the sponsoring developer in fiat.

## Prerequisites

- API key from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
- [A gas sponsorship policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/gas-manager/policy/create).

## Advanced

<Accordion title="Usage with prepare calls">

Gas sponsorship also works with the prepare calls methods in the various frameworks. Usage of the capability will be the same as when using send calls. It is recommended to use prepare calls if you want to inspect the prepared call prior to prompting the user for signature.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple policy IDs">
  Developers can configure multiple policy IDs for use in gas sponsorship. The
  backend will choose the first policy ID that where the transaction is eligible
  for sponsorship. This is done by passing an array of policy IDs instead of a
  single policy ID to the sponsor gas capability. See the [`wallet_prepareCalls`
  API
  parameters](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/api-reference/smart-wallets/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-api-endpoints/wallet-prepare-calls)
  for reference to the `paymasterService.policyIds` parameter.
