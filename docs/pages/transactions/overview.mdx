Smart Wallets' transaction system transforms how users interact with blockchain applications by providing a unified, developer-friendly interface for sending transactions across multiple chains. Whether you're building on EVM or Solana, Smart Wallets abstracts away the complexity while giving you powerful features like gasless transactions, batching, and cross-chain compatibility.

## What Makes Smart Wallets Transactions Different?

Smart Wallet transactions are powered by ERC-4337 account abstraction, which enables powerful features like gas sponsorship and modular smart accounts. This technology foundation also supports advanced capabilities including EIP-7702 integration for upgrading existing EOAs and robust transaction retry mechanisms for improved reliability.

### Key Advantages

**Gasless transactions**: Remove the biggest barrier to user adoption by sponsoring gas fees through Alchemy's Gas Manager, allowing users to transact without holding native tokens.

**Batch operations**: Execute multiple transactions atomically in a single operation, reducing costs and improving user experience.

**Multi-chain support**: Send transactions seamlessly across EVM chains and Solana with the same API.

**Enhanced security**: Leverage smart account features like multi-signature support, account recovery, and programmable transaction policies.

**EIP-7702 compatibility**: Upgrade existing EOAs to smart accounts without requiring users to create new addresses or transfer assets.

**Flexible gas payments**: Allow users to pay transaction fees with any ERC-20 token, not just native gas tokens.

### Gas Management

Smart Wallets provides sophisticated gas management through three approaches:

1. **Sponsored gas**: Complete gas abstraction using Gas Manager policies
2. **ERC-20 payments**: Users pay gas with stablecoins or custom tokens
3. **Traditional payments**: Standard ETH/native token gas payments

### Multi-chain Capabilities

#### EVM Support

Send transctions across all major EVM chains with features including:

- Single and batch operations
- Gas sponsorship and ERC-20 fee payments
- EIP-7702 delegation for existing EOAs
- Transaction retry and replacement mechanisms

#### Solana Integration

Native Solana support with specialized features:

- Solana transaction signing and sending
- Multi-signature coordination
- Instruction batching
- Custom signer integration

## Transaction Lifecycle

<Steps>

<Step title="Authenticate">
  Users must first authenticate to access their smart wallet before sending
  transactions. This process verifies user identity through various methods like
  email OTP, social login, or passkeys, creating a secure connection to their
  smart account. Learn more about [authentication options and
  implementation](/wallets/authentication/overview).
</Step>

<Step title="Preparing Transactions">
  Transactions are constructed with target addresses, data payloads, and value
  transfers. Multiple operations can be batched into a single atomic transaction
  for gas efficiency and atomic execution.
</Step>

<Step title="Signing Transactions">
  Smart accounts handle complex signing logic, including multi-signature
  coordination and custom validation rules. The system supports various signing
  methods from simple EOA signatures to advanced multi-party authorization.
</Step>

<Step title="Sending Transactions">
  Transactions are submitted to the blockchain with built-in retry mechanisms
  and status tracking. The system automatically estimates gas costs and applies
  sponsorship policies when configured.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitoring Transactions">
  Real-time status updates and transaction hash tracking provide seamless user
  experience. Once confirmed, the transaction results are available with
  detailed execution information and any relevant event logs.
</Step>
