Smart Wallets make it easy to send transactions across EVM and Solana. This section covers everything you need to know about preparing, signing, sending, and tracking transactions.

When a user sends a transaction, Smart Wallets handle every step. In this section, you’ll learn how to execute steps 2–5 to enable capabilities (ex: gas sponsorship) for your users:

1. Authenticate: User verifies their identity and accesses your app (see [Authentication](/wallets/authentication/overview))
2. Prepare: Prepare a transaction for submission
3. Sign: User signs the transaction
4. Send: Submit the transaction for inclusion onchain
5. Track & display data: Track the status of the transaction and display it to the user

# SDK vs. APIs

Use the SDK if you’re building with React, React Native, or other JavaScript frameworks. It provides ready-to-use hooks and utilities. Use the APIs directly if you’re building in other environments (ex: python, flutter) or want lower-level control.
