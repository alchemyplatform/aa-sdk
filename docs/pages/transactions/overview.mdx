Smart Wallets' transaction system transforms how users interact with blockchain applications by providing a unified, developer-friendly interface for sending transactions across multiple chains. Whether you're building on EVM or Solana, Smart Wallets abstracts away the complexity while giving you powerful features like gasless transactions, batching, and cross-chain compatibility.

## What Makes Smart Wallets Transactions Different?

Traditional blockchain transactions can be complex and expensive for users. Smart Wallets' infrastructure solves these challenges by introducing **User Operations** (UOs) - a more flexible and user-friendly approach to blockchain interactions.

### Key Advantages

**Gasless transactions**: Remove the biggest barrier to user adoption by sponsoring gas fees through Alchemy's Gas Manager, allowing users to transact without holding native tokens.

**Batch operations**: Execute multiple transactions atomically in a single operation, reducing costs and improving user experience.

**Multi-chain support**: Send transactions seamlessly across EVM chains and Solana with the same API.

**Enhanced security**: Leverage smart account features like multi-signature support, account recovery, and programmable transaction policies.

**EIP-7702 compatibility**: Upgrade existing EOAs to smart accounts without requiring users to create new addresses or transfer assets.

**Flexible gas payments**: Allow users to pay transaction fees with any ERC-20 token, not just native gas tokens.

## Core Concepts

### User Operations vs Transactions

While traditional transactions are limited by the capabilities of Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), **User Operations** leverage smart contract accounts to provide enhanced functionality:

- **Traditional transactions**: Limited to simple value transfers and contract calls, require native gas tokens
- **User Operations**: Support batching, gas sponsorship, custom validation logic, and flexible fee payment options

### Smart Account Types

Smart Wallets supports multiple smart account implementations:

- **ModularAccountV2**: Our recommended default with ERC-6900 compliance and EIP-7702 support
- **LightAccount**: Lightweight implementation optimized for gas efficiency
- **MultiOwnerLightAccount**: Supports multiple owners for shared account management

### Gas Management

Smart Wallets provides sophisticated gas management through three approaches:

1. **Sponsored gas**: Complete gas abstraction using Gas Manager policies
2. **ERC-20 payments**: Users pay gas with stablecoins or custom tokens
3. **Traditional payments**: Standard ETH/native token gas payments

## Multi-Chain Capabilities

### EVM Support

Send User Operations across all major EVM chains with features including:

- Single and batch operations
- Gas sponsorship and ERC-20 fee payments
- EIP-7702 delegation for existing EOAs
- Transaction retry and replacement mechanisms

### Solana Integration

Native Solana support with specialized features:

- Solana transaction signing and sending
- Multi-signature coordination
- Instruction batching
- Custom signer integration

## Transaction Lifecycle

<Steps>

<Step title="Construction">
  User Operations are constructed with target addresses, data payloads, and
  value transfers. Multiple operations can be batched into a single atomic
  transaction for gas efficiency and atomic execution.
</Step>

<Step title="Signing">
  Smart accounts handle complex signing logic, including multi-signature
  coordination and custom validation rules. The system supports various signing
  methods from simple EOA signatures to advanced multi-party authorization.
</Step>

<Step title="Gas Estimation and Sponsorship">
  The system automatically estimates gas costs and applies sponsorship policies
  when configured. Gas Manager policies determine whether transactions are
  sponsored, paid with ERC-20 tokens, or use traditional gas payments.
</Step>

<Step title="Submission and Monitoring">
  Operations are submitted to the blockchain with built-in retry mechanisms and
  status tracking. The system handles network congestion, fee fluctuations, and
  provides real-time status updates throughout the process.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirmation">
  Real-time status updates and transaction hash tracking provide seamless user
  experience. Once confirmed, the transaction results are available with
  detailed execution information and any relevant event logs.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### EIP-7702 Integration

Transform existing EOAs into smart accounts without requiring new addresses:

- Backward compatibility with existing wallets
- Gradual migration path for existing users
- Full smart account feature access

### Retry Mechanisms

Built-in transaction retry and replacement capabilities:

- Drop and replace for stuck transactions
- Automatic fee bumping
- Custom retry logic support

### Signing Flexibility

Support for various signing scenarios:

- Standard transaction signing
- Typed data signing (EIP-712)
- Raw hash signing
- Multi-signature coordination
- EIP-7702 authorization signing
