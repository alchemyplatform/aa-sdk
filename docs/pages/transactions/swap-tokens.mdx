The Swap API is the easiest way to integrate single-chain token swaps in your app. Cross-chain swaps are coming soon!

Key benefits:

- **Single-step flows:** Batch approve + swap + post-swap action (ex: deposits, transfers, contract calls) into a single transaction - made possible by smart wallets
- **Low latency:**
  - Built natively into Smart Wallets. Enables preparing gasless swaps with a single API call
  - No need to make calls to two providers to perform a swap
- **Simplified stack:** No need for third-party swap integrations

Key use cases:

- Native token swaps: Enable users to do gasless swaps without ever leaving your app
- Transact with any token: Let users transact with any token they have in their wallet (ex: ETH, WLD), while your contracts still receive your preferred token(ex: USDC).

<Tip>
    The Swaps API is in early access. The service is production ready, however there may be changes in the future to simplify the endpoint. We will let you know if/when that happens.

# The Swap flow

## **Flow**

1. Request a swap quote
2. Sign the prepared calls (swap + post swap action)
3. Send prepared calls (swap + post swap action)
4. Poll for confirmation

## **Swap options**

```tsx
// Mode 1: Swap exact input amount
{
  fromAmount: "0x2710";
} // Swap exactly 0.01 USDC (10000 in hex, 6 decimals)

// Mode 2: Get minimum output amount
{
  minimumToAmount: "0x5AF3107A4000";
} // Get at least 0.0001 ETH (18 decimals). We calculate how much USDC you need to spend to get at least your desired ETH amount!
```

# FAQs

## What chains are supported?

Chains supported (for now) are: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Berachain, BSC/BNB, Ink, Monad, Optimism, Polygon, Unichain and World Chain mainnets.

## Does the Swap API support cross-chain swaps?

Currently, the Swap API supports only single-chain swaps. Cross-chain swaps are coming soon!

## How do you encode values?

Values are simply passed as hexadecimal strings. The Swap API doesn't add complexity to consider decimals, so 0x01 is always the smallest amount of a given asset.
1 ETH, or DAI (18 decimals) is `0xDE0B6B3A7640000`
1 USDC (6 decimals) is `0xF4240`
This removes any ambiguity— if it’s numerical, it’s a hex.

## What is the expiry?

The expiry is an informational indicator of when you can expect to be able to process the swap request. If you’re at/near the expiry, it might be a good time to request a new quote.

## What if I’m using React?

Use the `@account-kit/react` package to access a `smartWalletClient`. This package automatically uses the Signer for user authentication & signing. [Check out the docs for getting started with React to learn more](/wallets/react/quickstart).
