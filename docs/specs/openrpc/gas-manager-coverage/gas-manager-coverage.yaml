          Optional fields that override our gas and fee estimates. Use this parameter to override: `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `callGasLimit`, `verificationGasLimit`, or `preVerificationGas`. 

          This will apply either:
          - absolutes overrides (using a hex string) simply overriding estimated values entirely OR
          - multiplier overrides relative to our estimates (in the format of { "multiplier": number } with max precision of 4 decimal places). For example, if the override value is { multiplier: 1.1 } for the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field, then a 1.1 multiplier, or a 10% increase, is applied to the estimated `maxPriorityFeePerGas` of the userOp.

          A higher buffer may give userOps a better chance to mine if the L1/L2 gas and fees change.

            "maxFeePerGas": "hex string" | { "multiplier": number },

      Requests gas coverage for a `UserOperation`.

      <Warning title="To be deprecated">
        Please use `alchemy_requestGasAndPaymasterAndData` instead.

        While you can use `alchemy_requestPaymasterAndData` to request a paymaster signature, it's important to note that this function requires gas fields to be part of the `UserOperation` passed as a parameter. These gas fields are influenced by the response of this endpoint, creating a circular dependency.

        To simplify this process, we introduced alchemy_requestGasAndPaymasterAndData. This function both estimates gas and provides signed `paymaster` and `paymasterData` fields, therefore resolving the circular dependency.
