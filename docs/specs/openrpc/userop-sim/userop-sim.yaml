methods:

    description: |
      Simulates userOperations and returns a list of asset changes.

      <Note title="Changes in blockchain's state could lead to different outcomes">
        The results provided by this method are based on the blockchain's state at the moment of simulation. Changes in the blockchain state, such as updates to contract variables or balances, can occur between the time of simulation and userOperation execution.

        This could lead to different outcomes than predicted. For instance, if a userOperation's effect is conditional on the current state of a contract, and this state is altered before the transaction is executed, the final result may not match the simulation.

        Please conside this potential variance when using the API.
      </Note>
