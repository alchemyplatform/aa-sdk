# account-kit/core

The `@account-kit/core` package contains all of the functionality that allows us to manage state within [`@account-kit/react`](/reference/account-kit/react). It builds on top of [`@account-kit/infra`](/reference/account-kit/infra),
[`@account-kit/signer`](/reference/account-kit/signer), and [`@account-kit/smart-contracts`](/reference/account-kit/smart-contracts) to provide you with a vertically integrated stack for building apps using our Embedded Accounts in your frontend applications.
This package is designed to be used by developers who want a lot of the utility that the React package provides, but are building outside of the React ecosystem.
