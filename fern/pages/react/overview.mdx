Account Kit provides a first-class, fullstack experience for building embedded accounts with React using Alchemy's Signer, Alchemy's Rundler, and Alchemy's Smart Contract Account implementations.
We provide both React hooks and UI components so you can focus on building the best user experience for your users, while focusing on the business logic of your application.

Check out the various guides and tutorials, or hop into the demo to customize the experience and start building.
